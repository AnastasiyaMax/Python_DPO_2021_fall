A bit of background. 

I have taught myself Pyhton and PostgreSQL. And recently I graduated from a full-time 3month web-dev bootcamp (which I enjoyed and did well).  

For the last couple of months now I have started applying for junior jobs (mostly backend &amp; fullstack) and although I get quite far in the rounds (the coding challenges are mostly no problem) I get stuck on the Whiteboard.

More specifically. 

In the first whiteboard challenge I had it was asked of me to conceptualize an Ebay clone, one site where the users can pick a product to bid one &amp; the page in which multiple user can bid on the product (index and show). I started asking questions to get more info, then I stated how I would tackle it, and then I started to sketch.

I wrote down the database schema, the backend in which I would my validations and routing, and lastly my frontend. After some questions from their part I even thought of telling them that we would need to setup a Websocket to which we would subscribe the users to the product page so they could see the biding offer live without refreshing.

At the end they started to ask me question about horizontal and vertical scaling, how I would reduce the time to fetch the last prices from the db and so on. I was lost. I thought I was doing well,  until they where hitting me with things I never heard about.

On to the second Whiteboard challenge (different company).

Here I was asked to sketch out how I would get from a JSON file that lies on a server to post specific things from that file to 3 social media API's. Alright I thought simple enough. 

Again same procedure, asking some questions, explaining my thought process. I ended up saying &amp; sketching that I would have one file with 3 functions (each dedicated to one API)  and at the top of the file I would get the JSON from the server, do some data processing as needed and the using each function to make a call to the API. 

Towards the end they interviewers started to take over and tell me about the ""Single-responsibility principle"" which I had never heard of, and that I should have prepossessed to multiple steps like:

JSON --&gt; data preprocessing API 1 --&gt; data processing API 1 --&gt; data pre-formatting API 1 --&gt; data formatting API 1 --&gt; API 1 call.

You get the picture.

Later in their rejection email they told me that I needed to get more experience in designing solutions, that  I was thinking ""code"" and could not abstract towards logic level.

So I guess I need to work on that. 

Here comes my question towards you. Are there any resources/challenges online that tackle these sort of problems that you can recommend?

I'm currently back on the job market looking to get into a junior / entry-level software developer position. I like my current job, but I'm more of a business analyst doing very light front-end coding, writing SQL queries, and making simple tools with Java to automate tasks where I work. 

I was originally feeling pretty confident with my skills because I like what I do and I'm proud of some of the scripts and development projects I've worked on (I've been in this role for a couple years) but quickly found that there are knowledge / experience gaps I have that get me screened out in initial interviews. I don't use the latest frameworks like react or angular in my front-end developing, and I also don't have any real back-end experience. So, nobody wants me, even if I emphasize my willingness to learn.

Has anyone been in this position, and what would you recommend in order to build decent enough experience to land a role? Obviously I should study up on these frameworks and skills in general, but I feel lost about what is valued in back-end experience since my work now doesn't really expose me to a true software developer's environment. If I tried standing up a website with a back-end database, is that the sort of thing that would show interviewers I'm capable? And for frameworks, should I be careful about which I choose to practice? There are so many front and back-end frameworks, I feel like I'm so underqualified and I don't know where to start. 

With side projects, I have trouble coming up with ideas and I quickly feel overwhelmed scrolling through job postings that mention so many different frameworks I don't know... it seems like a lot to be catching up on, since I just write simple java apps and do my front-end development with JQuery/vanilla javascript and html/CSS.

I will try my best to keep this brief but wall of text inbound:

&amp;nbsp;

Experience:

- BS Computer Science.
- ~10yrs total professional software dev.

Made up of:

- ~5yrs C#/.NET at a few companies.
- ~5yrs gamedev with Unity.
- ~2yrs solo indie dev - launched a couple of games.
- ~3yrs working at household brand making Unity apps with millions of users.

&amp;nbsp;

Background:

I started in traditional desktop software dev with C#. I found the work to be too boring and wanted to pivot into gamedev, more importantly I wanted to make my own games. I was fortunate enough to finally make that dream come true but like 99% of solo devs I failed to make any money and was forced to go back into the corporate world. I was fortunate again, to find work that was relevant to gamedev and my new Unity experience making ~100k on the East Coast. I continue to work on my business on the side until it is profitable enough to go full-time (again).

&amp;nbsp;

Problem:

It is important to me to have time and energy to continue work on my side projects (games). With the new inflation issues and due to a lack of good yearly raises - I find myself essentially making less money than when I started this job. Money isn't my priority but I need to keep my head above water. I find myself crippled to make a decision on what to do next.

I could probably get a small pay raise if I pushed for it but my role is also mentally demanding as I work on a micro team that forces me to wear ""every hat"" and leaves me drained at the end of the day/week. My flow is often interrupted leaving me to play catch up. On top of that, it seems like the game industry is bleak for engineers compared to other CS fields. I have started submitting my resume (for Unity gamedev) and already interviewing with +20-30% salary on the table but nothing compared to other industries with my years of experience. It seems like recent grads are making more than me according to this sub.

In the past, I have forgone money and benefits for WLB and flexibility. It seems like a pivot to full-stack dev would give me a lot more options for finding jobs (especially remote) while also paying much more. I wonder if at my age/experience if a pivot is possible or worth it. In the long run it would pay better but would it take away from my side project? Working on games has given me some exposure to the cloud but not much.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR:

- Can't choose between fighting for more pay at current gamedev job, finding a new gamedev job, or pivoting to another path (full-stack dev?).
- Worried about gamedev job market if I need to look for work post pandemic (more jobs atm).
- Worried it is too late to pivot (I am confident in my practical skills but haven't considered interview problems in forever).
- I am passionate about gamedev but working on games for someone else has lost its luster. A growing part of me wants to leave the industry.
- Working for myself on the side is incredibly important and spending time preparing and looking for work is time consuming.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking to see if anyone has had any similar career flip-flops or stories. There are other details/nuances that I left out to hide my identity.

So, I just started my Master's degree in CS in the US but I have 0 industry/internship experience from my home country. I am clueless as to where to start. I only know the basics (theory) of my undergrad in CS. This is my first semester as a graduate student in the US and I feel like I know nothing about computer science compared to my classmates. I feel so terrible and insecure.

Currently, they have started accepting applications for summer internships and when I see the job descriptions/responsibilities, I feel like I do not have enough experience for the internship anyway, so what's the point of applying?

As the business does everything within digital marketing and sales, it should reflect the business and myself personally, so a ""fancy"" title was welcomed. 

My tasks: 

All of them are in relations to the business market. We offer stuff like graphic design, websites, SEO etc. Generally everything within digital marketing.

\- Create / update existing - ""Google My Business"" accounts, verify, find content from Social media if available - or create everything from scratch. Find images on shutterstock, write texts about what they offer, contact info, posts etc. Optimize all images, posts and generally the profile for Google crawlers. (SEO) 

\- Create / update Google Ads, Adsense, Analytics, Keywordplanner, Google trends campaigns etc.. 

\- Create Facebook/Instagram/Snap ad campaigns.

\- Edit photos / Optimize them for quality purposes. Eventually I hope I can create logos for customers as well as that is something I am interested in. 

\- Customer contact. Following up existing customers to see how their campaign is going, if they are happy/unhappy and if there is something I can do to make everything better. Update their stuff if they have new info. And soften them up so that the salesteam has an easier job identifying their needs when they call back to sell them more products or extend their plan.

I feel like because of the customer follow-up part it makes the role a little weirder to define. Because I feel like I do pretty advanced stuff to call myself a customer service agent or something along those lines. I've been working sales before as well, and I'm pretty good, so I've been informed that I even can do that certain days if I feel like it.

I don't know where to start, I am bad at explaining stuff usually, but when I first started the job seemed great and everyone was willing to help me and stuff. I still kinda feel that, but I have noticed things have definitely taken a backseat.

As of lately, about the past month or so, I feel like I haven't been doing a whole lot of work, while my coworkers are constantly being assigned to do work. We pretty much are able to select our own stories, and we have our senior guys who go through the on call cycle (I'm not on the list yet since I am fairly new). I have done a lot of UI and front-end work. Since we have released the app, there isn't too much to do on the UI now and I am kinda stagnanting here. 

Every week I have a 1 on 1 with my boss. He tells me what's going on and I can ask him whatever I want. I do like my boss and overall he is a pretty chill guy and easy to talk to. He told me that he likes to see me and some of the other people do a bit more than just UI stuff. I never really took that as a negative, or really never took it as him calling me out on anything, just as like a general thing. I agree with him, I would love to do more work particularly outside of the UI since I am a Full Stack Developer. 

I do enjoy what I do and the people I work with, I have learned a lot within the past 8 months and honestly, I don't see myself voluntarily leaving anytime in the near future. But I cannot help but keep thinking that sometime they will let me go, and it stressed me out more because I have to do the whole technical interview process which I completely suck at and will never be able to do well with. Odds are getting a new job I will probably be thrown in some kind of shitty work environment.

Not too sure what to do.

I'm a software engineer with around 3 years of professional experience, but about 10+ years in the workforce during college, etc.

I recently quit an old corporate job in a tech stack I wasn't that interested in. The reason I left the prior job is I got exceeding expectations on my last performance review and when a position on a team with a more interesting tech stack appeared I was told to not apply by my supervisor and manager. In other words, I was told to stay in my lane. This was the catalyst for me to get a new job since I don't think that's a good way to treat an employee who ""exceeds"" expectations. I was also underpaid for what I did by about $30,000 after being skilled up by the same company.

I found a new job with better pay and a more interesting tech stack. However, I've noticed at this new company there is a lot of sarcasm during meetings (meanness imo) and it seems like people are just as dead inside as I remember from my past corporate jobs. I never realized how similar corporate culture really is until this job. I've worked at 3 corporations and I've come to realize they're all the same with a different coat of paint.

I literally just started a couple days ago and already have a pit in my stomach and dread work. I don't even have tasks assigned. I don't even have access to do the tasks yet lol. However, I thought this feeling was because of the old tech stack I had. I've come to realize I just cannot stand corporations at all.

Is there a solution to this? My mind is all over the place since I'm already apathetic about the work when I feel like I should be excited for the new opportunity. It makes me want to just quit with no back up plan and explore other career paths. I feel like I'd rather make less money and not hate myself.

And you want to guess why? It’s not because of the economy, it’s not because the employer is being unreasonable and it’s not because they have no other offers to leverage.

Most of those people lost right then and there when they decided to not even try to negotiate for a higher salary.

In this blog, I’m gonna first help you understand the three practical consequences of not negotiating, because I have the best salary negotiation strategies in the world, but if you don’t get over that mental barrier first, none of it matters.

Then I’m going to share my five favorite tips when negotiating salary, after receiving a job offer. So that you can put it to practice right away. So let’s get started.

Hi friends, if you’re new here, my name is Deepak we’re all about practical career and interview tips. So if you’re a current student or young professional consider subscribing for more actionable content.

The most common reason candidates are hesitant to negotiate salary is because they believe they have no bargaining power. A fresh graduate might think, well, this is my first job, I have no experience, I have no bargaining power.

Even experienced professionals might think, if I have no other offers, I have no leverage, but here’s what you have to understand.

The hiring process is stressful and expensive for the other side as well. Employers screen hundreds, if not thousands of resumes, spend countless hours analyzing and choosing applicants before finally deciding on a few to hire.

By this point, the employer is investing in those candidates. So even fresh graduates have some bargaining power. Diving into three very real consequences if you choose not to negotiate your salary after receiving a job offer.

### 3 Consequences If You Don’t Negotiate

First and foremost, compounding means you lose out financially in a very big way. Imagine two people with a 10% difference in starting salary,$50,000 a year and $55,000 a year. Now, let’s assume that both receive a 6% salary increase very year for the next 30 years. By year 10, the difference in their cumulative pay will be around $75,000, by year 20, $200,000. And by year 30, a whopping $424,000, almost enough to buy that new iPhone.

Now this oversimplified example doesn’t even take into account future career moves. If you move to another company, that nice 20% pay bump that they’re offering, that’s anchoring to what you’re being paid currently. So often, this $424,000 gap is way larger.

Number two, by choosing not to negotiate, you lose out on factors that the employer could have easily have said yes to. More vacation days, education reimbursement, a later start date. And number three, you lose out on an opportunity to make a strong first impression on your employer.

Negotiation is a valuable life skill that benefits you both personally and professionally. Your employer knows this, and by even attempting to negotiate, that might make you even more attractive in their eyes.

If you can relate to what I’ve talked about so far, drop a like and let me know down in the comments, if you’ve ever tried to negotiate salary before, Hopefully by now, you’re more comfortable with the idea of negotiating salary after receiving a job offer, but what exactly do you do? **Here are my top five techniques.**

**You may also read:** [**5 Golden Rules: Write an Incredible Resume**](https://professionalsampleresume.com/5-golden-rules-write-an-incredible-resume/)

### Be Comfortable

Tip number one, imagine you’re negotiating for a close friend or for a loved one. I found a subtle change in mindset instantly helps you become more confident and assertive.

Think about it, your close friend, he or she worked hard for this offer, spent countless hours on interview prep, revamped their resume 20 times, give up Netflix, Netflix for a month.

Doesn’t he or she deserved to be paid their worth? You feel that? That feeling is called indignation, anger at being treated unfairly. Use that to overcome your fear of negotiation.

### Give Employer a Specific Figure

Tip number two, give a specific salary figure as opposed to a nice round number. So what this means is that if you say $57,650 instead of $57,000, you are much more likely to get to a final number closer to what you were expecting in the first place, it turns out according to a research done by Columbia Business School, your employer is more likely to assume you’ve done extensive research into your market value to reach that specific salary number.

It makes anecdotal sense as well because if you have a friend working in a role that you’re applying for with similar background and experience and he or she tells you exactly what they make, you can be fairly confident that this is a number you can successfully negotiate for as well.

### Do Research About The Company

Tip number three, have a worst case scenario, a walkaway point. Yes, you should do research and come up with a target ideal number.

You should check out salary ranges on the sites that I throw on-screen hereon the link down below and choose a number at the 80 to 85% mark.

The point of having a worst case scenario in mind is that you’re mentally prepared to walk awayif the final offer is so low that you have to turn it down. You don’t want to accept something that’s just not financially viable or make you regret it afterwards.

### Justify Your Salary

Tip number four, come to the table with facts, not feeling. Your employer is much more likely to consider your salary negotiating proposal if you provide justifications.

Because this helps them understand why you deserve what you’re requesting. Saying that you deserve a 15% increase in salary because you have two more years of working experience than the average person on the team is a much stronger argument than just throwing out the 15% number.

Of course, it’s easy to come off as arrogant by mistake when providing justifications. So here’s a sample answer for your reference.

The industry average is $62,500 a year, not including benefits. And I found that Unilever actually pays a bit more than that at 64,000.

The offer you gave is slightly below both these numbers and I’d like to understand a bit more about the reasoning behind that.

With my four years of experience in consumer goods since graduation and based on my conversation with the hiring manager, I feel like I’m uniquely positioned to help with this issue she’s facing.

Is there any way we can get closer to the industry benchmark? Notice I use very neutral language, brought up what their competitor was paying and highlighted how my background was well positioned to help them with their challenges that they’re facing right now. The combination of all these helps me come off as reasonable without being too pushy.

### Being Ethical Is Important

Tip number five, negotiate salary offer ethically. You should only negotiate with an employer, who’s offered you plan to accept if the negotiation goes well. It is unethical to negotiate with an employer who’s offer you have no intention of accepting even if your preferred terms are met.

Once you have accepted an offer, you really shouldn’t continue interviewing with other employers. If you are interviewing with other organizations, you should reach out directly and let them know that you’ve already accepted an offer and you are withdrawing from the application process. At this point, be sure not to burn any bridges.

* Education: MS CS-related at T10 school
* Prior Experience: 1 internship
* Company: Big 5
* Title: Software Engineer
* Total comp: 230k

I got my MS from a top 10 CS school, but I graduated with no internship experience and a sub 3.0 GPA. I applied to around 50 jobs at random before I stopped logging them. I got no responses, and was quickly discouraged. I was working but left on bad terms so I couldn't put it on my resume. And then I became a NEET.

Now, while I was a NEET I think I did do a few things right.

1. I kept contact with my friends who went into tech. It was tough since I avoided talking about myself, but I kept up to date on what they were doing.
2. I volunteered. It wasn't anything special but it gave me some much needed socialization and it was something I could put on my resume to at least show I wasn't doing literally nothing. It also gave me something to talk about when it came to behavioral interviews.
3. I kept up with my hobbies. I like to paint and I like to train a sport, and these came up in interviews and helped make me seem more personable, I think. I talked to other painters and I stayed active through my sport, which kept me from becoming an insane basement gremlin.

Two years ago I had enough and decided to start the grind. My journey from this point was slow and messy, and I'm sure someone with a better attitude and discipline could have progressed a lot faster in my shoes. But this is what I could do consistently.

My base was [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), [Fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), and [A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Computer_Systems_Pearson_New_Internation/ji-pBwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;kptab=overview). My focus bounced from UX/UI to front-end to fullstack. I tried to focus as much as possible on making projects that I could display in my portfolio, and grinded Leetcode when I felt burnt out. I picked up a position as an unpaid intern at some point and did a brief contract gig for a local company at the recommendation of a friend. It wasn't much, but it at least gave me some technical experience I could talk about in interviews.

I started getting interviews from companies about six months ago. I didn't pass any of them but it was enough for me to know that I could still hang with the crowd. I asked for a Big 5 referral from one of my tech friends and got the green light. I also got offers from two other companies, which helped me negotiate my offer up before I accepted.

In the past year I've applied to around 200 jobs. AngelList, Hired, and TripleByte were good for getting interviews with relatively little effort, which allowed me to focus more on studying. LinkedIn only started yielding results after I got the technical experience mentioned previously, formatted my resume to pass ATS filter, and put up my personal website.

I know prospects for people with no experience who haven't managed to break into the industry within a couple years tend to be gloomy, but it is possible. Don't lose hope.

The one I accepted is company A while the one that I like is company B.

Company A is a small firm of 50 and I’m going to use flutter/dart (never used it before) C#, and new stuff like firebase. The requirements were just mobile development and a bachelors degree (any it seems). They’re going to teach me on the job. I don’t know the culture that well but the CEO is super cool and laid back while the people I’ve met were also great. The IT director was kinda aloof and he acts as the HR guy as well which was interesting. When I selected a start date when he gave me two options he didn’t reply since then but that could just be him.

Company B is much larger and has slightly better benefits and pay. It’s also a company I’ve interned at before and I know how the culture and values are. The team seems great and I think I’d work well with them. I just don’t want to go to hybrid since staying with my folks saves me a lot. The tech stack also uses C# and Angular/Typescript. 

I don’t think the expectations are going to be high for Company b which is good since I’m so new, but Company A might stress me out for all we know. Also, company A only gave me two days to accept my offer so I had to take it anyway.

Should I reneg Company A in favor of B? B has had a much more traditional hiring process while A seemed weird since I don’t even know the language and they didn’t give me any technical question harder than “what’s the difference between and abstract class and interface.” I should mention that Company B’s team is small and close knit apparently.

I knew that when I accepted this job, but it's rough out there for new grads with no internships. I have a good work life balance and the learning environment is great, but I'm paid laughably bad. 

I work for a company that gets public funding and is peripherally involved with education and that's as specific as I want to go. I knew the compensation would be low. 

But even without any internships, any experience, someone with a bachelor's degree in computer science from an ABET accredited engineering program should not be making 45k in a medium cost of living City. 

I tracked down our salary guidelines. The position I'm in is system programmer level 2. The position is actually for 2+ years experience (I had zero) and the salary range actually started at 28.5k (holy shit) and went up to 59k. The mod point is 43k. My boss had to pull really hard to get me above the mid point (hr was fighting him on it) since I didn't have any experience. Level 2 is non-exempt (technically hourly) and level 3 is salary. 

Last week I used this as an excuse to bring up a possible promotion organically with my boss. We were talking about people working from home (him and I go to the office every day) and what time most people prefer to work, so I asked if programmer 3 was salary (I knew the answer). He answered, but it drove the conversation to when I should expect to be promoted to level 3. 

He said that level 3 was 5+ years of experience but that (like he did with my current position) he believed he could get hr to approve it after 2 years. 

This was not what I wanted to hear. I can't work for 45k a year for 2 years. I barely can get by now with my private loan payments, now federal loan payments are about to restart. 

I think I'm going to get my 1 year of experience, grind some leet code, polish up my resume, and maybe do a pet project in my spare time, and start applying places at the 1 year mark. The learning experience here has fantastic and I want to make use of it. 

But I don't even think I can survive 45k for the rest of that 1 year. 

I technically don't need promoted to move up to 59k. How should I (and when should I) talk to my boss about moving me to the higher end of the compensation range for my current level. I'd be blunt that I'm not going to be able to pay my bills come February when loans restart. 

But to the question in the title, should I consider it a red flag that a company would keep someone with a CS degree at 28k-59k for 2 years?

Two weeks ago I decided to start learning some coding, mainly HTML/CSS/JS, to be able to make my Wordpress website better. After starting to learn JS I noticed that it was much more exciting than I had ever expected, for some reason I thought that programming was kinda similar to writing an article, but just with a different language (I know, I was stupid).   
After a few days I noticed that there is a lot of logic/problem-solving involved, which made me start doing some codewars puzzles (that I liked doing), but instead these past days I've been focusing on getting a general idea of how Computer Science works from low to high-level of abstraction, I also started a book that I found recommended on Reddit called: ""Introduction to the Theory of Computation"".

Even though I know that learning front-end website would be my easiest path, since my website back-end is already on Wordpress anyway, I find myself wanting to learn different stuff because I don't like much managing a website, also I don't think that I would like to create them for others.

So I thought that some good-hearted Reddit users could help me to have a guideline of where to go, as at my age I can't afford to ramble much. **My goal is to be able to work in the industry in a maximum of 2 years (studying \~20 hours a week), and then continue studying to develop further my career as I'm working.**

# My traits:

1. I'm introverted and I have some social issues that makes it hard for me to be able to talk with many people at the same time comfortably. I'm fine being with people online and I'm fine if I just have one person in front of me, but the more people the harder it is, so **stuff like working in a big team or working with many clients is a NO for me**. Presentations would be okish.
2. I've been competing in games since I was a teen, in some cases professionally, so my brain has adapted to that. **I'm competitive but mostly just towards myself and I learnt to manage/be part of small teams**.
3. Games also made me **good under pressure, but regular stress isn't for me**.
4. I think I'm **good at troubleshooting**. I can see problems and I like to fix them.
5. I coached in a videogame for some time. I'm patient with people, I'm a good listener and I'm observant. I don't think that helps much in this industry, but who knows!
6. I have a bad memory: **I don't have a precise memory**, I can remember concepts well but not particular words or numbers, unless I'm very familiarized with the topic.
7. I'm **good at short-term planning and improvising**, but not as good at long plans (that's probably why I'm here asking for help)
8. I stopped studying at 16, so even though I was always talented at maths, I don't have a high knowledge now.

1. Most of my learning must be **self-taught**. I don't mind earning a certificate or some small courses, but from my experience I learn better when I don't follow teachers' instructions.
2. **I don't want to deal much with hardware**. I'm fine dealing with some cables and doing easy stuff with components, but that can't be most of my job.
3. It can't be very time-consuming. My first job shouldn't require more than 30 hours a week, I'm also fine having to be at work for 40 hours if I still have **free time to spend on other activities**.
4. What I learn and then my work experience in work must be somewhat **helpful in other aspects of life**. As an example learning how to play a videogame isn't very helpful in other life areas even if you end up getting money from it, and also not very useful for the future.

I tried to summarize as much as I could while still giving a broad idea of me. If anyone can help me in some way to know how to start my CS career properly, either short-term or long-term I would thank them for life, as this is important for me.

During my first week my boss gave me a Pluralsight tutorial on Angular so that I'd learn the basics and be able to read the codebase, this was fine because I'd delved into Javascript, Html and CSS before in my own time. Moving my mindset over to Angular was no hassle, the problems began when he seemed to want me to hurry up with the tutorial, for me I like to take my time with these things and really grasp the concepts I'm learning, that means making notes, running my own examples, going back over videos to  to look over a concept I might've misunderstood initially or just to look at it again. This is the method of learning that got me through Uni and it worked for me for the most part. It was a 5 hour tutorial, which could've taken me a week to properly get through, to me it seems like he wanted me to just watch it straight and get to coding by the end of the week, which caused me to rush through it and not really properly take in the content of the tutorial.

Eventually I got through it and got to looking at the code of the website, What. A. Mess. Even my boss described it as ""spaghetti code"", it was truly difficult figuring out what exactly did what and how the code was structured, my first task was implementing a search function on a kanban list. Okay, not too difficult, especially considering that the functionality existed on the site already on other lists, I just had to copy that, and the Pluralsight tutorial had a search function too so I could just refer to that if I got stuck. This was my first run in with the still-in-development API, an API that constantly breaks with new changes, maybe this is normal in the industry, but as a new dev it left me constantly questioning whether I was doing something wrong or if it was just the API being incomplete. Which brings us back to the search functionality, I swear I'm doing the right thing, I can see in the DOM that I'm making the right call, but it's not searching, I ask my boss what I'm doing wrong, he says ""follow through the code"" uuuuhh okay, I guess. I keep trying but it's not working, I'm practically tearing my hair out, anxiety through the roof, finally a day later my boss goes through my code, I tell him I tried what I could but I didn't get it to work, he says it is working, just the API isn't processing the call correctly or whatever. He tells me to tell the API dev to implement the call correctly. Damn, you could've told me that before I wasted hours trying to figure out this impossible task.

Examples like the above happen over and over, but I become used to it and start grasping this messy codebase, I learn how the codebase is structured, services, view models, CRUD, etc. It's still a nightmare to navigate but I understand better now. I learn how to implement fixes to bugs and communicate with the API dev about calls that I'm making that aren't working, stressful, but I'm getting there.

Throughout this whole process my boss is guiding me through a lot different challenges, like dynamic forms, for instance, he would show me an example and it was up to me to implement it, of course he's the more senior developer so I refer to him whenever I have a problem or question, but it seems like the more questions I ask him the more annoyed he gets with me. My anxiety sometimes leads me to ask obvious questions, even questions I know the answers to, only because I have a inkling of doubt, so to clear up my doubt I ask and make sure whatever I'm doing is the right thing to do. I guess he just wants me to know what to do at all times, this leads me to kinda start secretly resenting him and not asking for guidance whenever I need it. I'm a professional though so I'll never show it.

All of this came to a head quite recently, to a space where I feel like I've just been thrown to the wolves, Azure B2C. Now all of the ability I have in Angular has taken me the past 3 months to cultivate, I'm not perfect, probably not even good, but I feel competent, I know way more now than when I started. But I don't know a damned thing about B2C implementation, not on this website, not on any website, it's not been something put in my plate, and from what I can see it would take me quite a while to understand it. Here's the kicker, my boss doesn't even understand how to get it working, he's been trying for weeks now alongside other developers to get it up and running and now as a final last ditch effort he's turned to me to figure it out. And to figure it out by the end of the day, like what, I can fix bugs, sure, implement a new list, buttons, validation, all of that easily, but I'm not figuring out B2C in a day especially when you don't even understand it and how to fix it yourself. When I told him I don't understand he said the same ""follow through the code"". Follow through what code, I don't even know where to begin with this!

There are other stuff I'm leaving out for privacy's sake, but it could summed up as a general lack of professionalism and planning.

I guess I'm just venting, maybe I'm wrong and this is normal, but I just feel so overwhelmed, my question would be after all that should I just leave this job?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently looking study in one of these universities for an undergraduate degree:

1. University of Szeged - Computer Science Bsc (Hungary)
2. Johannes Kepler University Linz - Artificial Intelligence Bsc (Austria)

&amp;#x200B;

I’m interested in AI and ML, in particular healthcare and bioinformatics and genetics implementations,  but I also am interested in other fields like autonomous driving.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure which university would benefit me the most, the Szeged computer science degree although outdated in some areas, would give me the basic conventional education in CS and then I can build on top of it. On the other hand the AI degree is quite new and one of the first in Europe, the JKU Linz institute is led by Sepp Hochreiter, the co-inventor of LTSTM, and the curriculum is set by him, and the institute is one of the best in European AI research. 

I’ll link the curriculums to both of the degrees, any thoughts, pros and cons of these degrees would be much appreciated.

University of Szeged - Computer Science Bsc: 

The curriculum is only available in Hungarian, so Ill translate it here:

So far, my supervisor is very kind, the people in my team are alright, they have been very flexible with me eg. let me work remotely, mainly because I mentioned in the beginning that I still am full time studying (and even allowed me to go abroad for short time which was requirement from my university). I recently just got back. 

The tasks I have right now are however less technically and I learn mostly about business, which is fine with me. My tasks mainly are joining meetings, preparing presentations, reporting, explaining how to use certain BI tools, etc. 

This week they asked me whether I wanted to extend my internship with them, since they know that after this internships end I have to focus on my thesis in combination with an internship that can support me with that. In the meantime I also applied to some internship positions and to my surprise I got offered one from the company and topic I was very interested in. The only catch here however is that they want to start earlier and asked me whether I can start in ~1 month for parttime and then when I don’t have courses anymore full time (working on my thesis with them). 

So my current internship is with company A and company B gave me above offer. 

In a nutshell, for company B: 
• Established topic I’m very interested in and which is related to my studies.
• Very technical which I believe will teach me a lot regarding eg video analysis and others. 
• Supervisor with a technical background. 
• Very big well known company which is hard to get into. 
• Travelling only 1 hour and also offer some  remote days. 
• Better pay (although pay in EU for internships is barely nothing). 
• The chance to get a job offered after my internship. 
• Having part time hours instead of full time next to my current course load can be very beneficial to me since I’m barely managing it due to lack of time. 

Company A: 
• No topic, currently have tasks here and there. They want me to make the organisation more data driven but when I have an idea it’s not possible because a lot is done by external parties. Less related to my studies than expected.
• Not very technical so far, but according to them I can take the initiative to do so.
• Supervisor is very kind but does not have a technical background so it’s on me to find the right person who can perhaps help me with the issue I’m facing. 
• Less big company but known by most people. I’m their first intern btw. 
• Travelling is more than 2.5 hours and I dread it tbh. Whenever I can I join remote. 
• Less pay. Basically when you subtract the travelling cost I’m not even sure whether I can make it break even. 
• They told me this week that they actually cannot hire me as full employee after my internship (in contrast to what they said before), because the people above in charge want to hire someone of senior level instead of junior. 
• Still fulltime although somewhat flexible hours. But I have had many moments I wanted to quit since I cannot give 100% for either school, or internship, and have no free time at all to pay attention to my health (eat well, sleep well, exercise, etc)

I think it’s clear I really want to go with company B, but I feel bad about quitting earlier and I’m not sure how to tell them that. In my contract it’s mentioned it can be terminated when both parties agree. I don’t know if one month notice is too short… I also have one week planned in the next month for which I haven’t asked for free yet so that’s also something I still need to bring up (cause I chickened out last time).

but when covid hit I got laid off and it was the perfect time. 

things have taken a turn for the better, the stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits, and the AMC short squeeze and living rent free for nearly a year now have let me save up more money than I've ever had.

and with the gi bill paying for my housing for 9 out of the 12 months of the year I can dedicate myself fully to school. 

ive read the FAQ and it seems an AA is not very useful, so I guess I have to get a BA. Im a little bummed out because I really like the coding aspect, I've been playing around with python, but I really don't want to go through useless college course, at least at it pertains to my degree.

Looking for some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a new job 2 months ago to the day as a full stack developer. My interest and experience lies firmly in front end development but I am more than willing to do some back end work. I said this during the interview stage and they assured me that I would be predominantly working on front end as there is a lot that needs doing in that area of the product. Well, it's been 2 months and the only front end I've done is changing the colour of a button.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was contacted by a recruiter regarding a senior front end position that sounds a lot more appealing. Should I stick it out for a bit longer or should I jump ship? Has anyone else had a similar experience and can offer any advice?
