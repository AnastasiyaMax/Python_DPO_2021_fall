I  am graduating with a BS in CS this coming spring and am looking for something besides software engineering. I had a DevOps internship which  was somewhat enjoyable, as well as working at the medical devices center  on campus with VR development and 3D printing which was more up my  alley.

I am really interested in  machinery and vehicles, but it seems as though most of the development  is done by electrical engineers. Similar story with manufacturing (from  my research).

Confused uni student here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background about me. I've interned at a startup for 1 year, mostly working with Reactjs, and PHP. I really hated PHP, and overall found the direction of the company to be pretty dysfunctional, so I started looking for internships/grad roles at different companies. I got an offer from a pretty large B2B SaaS company after interviewing for them as an APM and Software Engineer. They knocked back my Software Engineering application because they thought I'd be better suited as an APM, I did both interviews pretty well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took the offer as an APM because I had nothing else lined up and I was about to graduate in 3 months back then, and their grad package was a lot higher than what the startup offered me. However, I absolutely hate the role of an APM. It's so business/sales focused at this company and I feel as though I'm wasting valuable time I can gain as a developer. I spoke to my manager about this and they said they offer career planning every 6 months if you opt into that program, and said if you want to switch to a dev role then you can.

&amp;#x200B;

I left on pretty good terms with the previous startup, with my ex tech lead being a pretty good friend of mine to this day, he mentioned I'm always welcomed back. I'm at a bit of a crossroads here, do I go take the job at the old startup, or slug it out at this current role for 6 months, the B2B company uses React as well and Java, however I'd opt to go into their Java team because I enjoy working with it more.

So when I went to college this was kind of the lens I thought through. It became obvious that college was not a requirement for this job so I quit. I worked as a sysadmin for about 5 years and it was fine and I probably would have continued to be a sysadmin but there were some management changes I didn't like so I moved to a new company as a ""Devops"" engineer. This was better increased pay more interesting work. While being a devops engineer I got the opportunity to go work at a startup ( 5 people in a garage the classic tale) . At the startup I realized being a devops engineer was not great so I slowly evolved into a Software Engineer And this was ok, it made more sense anyways for a company of that size and all was good. Eventually we did ok and the company was acquired. I didn't love the acquiring company so I went ahead and moved onto another company as a ""Sr"" Devops engineer. Thats where I am now I enjoy my work.

  I was talking to a friend who works at google and he was unhappy that he wont get promoted as fast as he would like. I was kinda shocked I thought "" Wow this guy makes a TON of money  why is he upset?"" Well the reason he is upset is because he wants his career to keep moving forward. So this got me thinking am I supposed to want to move up? Its not that I don't want to. But I don't want to be a manager yet I feel like I have a TON to learn. Obviously there are ways to move up and not be a manager.

I guess I always thought I would work and make enough money to eventually start my own company or just spend more time working on things I am personally interested in. Climbing the corporate ladder is just not an option that I really ever gave much thought.  

I guess I am at a point where I feel like ok I can start a company at least I have the funds if thats what I want to do.  But I never considered this idea of joining a large company ( the company I work at is growing fast enough) In order to ""climb the ladder"" if you will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I am wondering if climbing the ladder makes sense? I already make more money than I need but certainly not as much as I want. It just seems like there is a TON I need to learn to keep moving up as an engineer and I am not sure the associated stress is really worth it.

I'm currently a QA automation engineer, with about 7 years' experience, and I've been a dev in the past. In the distant past, before my CS career begin, I was a team lead in several different jobs, so I'm comfortable coaching, mentoring, scheduling, and resolving conflicts.

I'm trying to make the jump to QA team lead, and to no-one's surprise it's a pretty big hurdle. I get to a third interview on nearly any team lead job I apply for, and then a very polite email that they've decided to go for someone who has more experience. The classic ""You need experience to get experience.""

In my current job my boss has spoken to me about advancing my career and moving up. I'm taking some internal training courses, and leading meetings here and there, which is all well and good. But I've also kept an eye on org announcements and nearly no team lead positions are filled by internal candidates, it's mostly people coming from outside the company. So while my boss may have the best of intentions, the pattern doesn't support my hopes and dreams, and it's more likely I'm filling an assistant team lead role without the title or pay.

After that long intro, on to my question: Can I entice hiring managers to take a chance on me with more education? The whole reason I got started in CS was because while I liked computers, I had no specific qualifications. I went to school, got a 2 year diploma and broke into the industry. Things stagnated so I went back and did 2 more years to finish off my degree and higher pay followed almost immediately.

That was a very clear path, though. I don't know how leadership works. I don't have time to futz about with a full on BA or MBA, but what other options are there? Is there any sort of certification or one year program for ""new leaders"" or something that won't look like a waste of money on a resume?

I was very fortunate to get an internship my Sophomore year in 2017. This lead to me getting a co-op internship the semester after. Which lead to another semester long co-op else where. Which lead to a summer internship at a different company. Which lead to a part time internship during the school year with a different company. And finally, lead me to another full time summer + part time throughout the year internship. So before graduating I secured 6 internships, and was able to get a full time offer from another company before graduating. And I've been working here ever since (\~6 months). 

Out of the 6 internships I got return offers on 4 and think I did reasonably well. It was just life circumstances that made me not come back. The other 2 my performance could have been better, but based on the position and the state of the company they said they couldnt give me a (even a verbal) return offer.

a break down of my experience:

internship 1: 8 months all part time (got return offer)

internship2: 6 months full time (got return offer)

internship3: 4 months full time (got return offer)

internship4: 3 months full time (no return offer)

internship5:8 months part time (no return offer)

internship6: 11 months  full time + part time (got return offer)

full time job: 6 months and going

My current position is not exactly what I expected. They use dated terminology, but essentially I am a devops engineer. And I enjoy the work but I feel like im not getting challenged as much as I could. And I work IT in a large organization, and I would love to work for a tech company. I've been eyeing some openings at this other company, and an opening that describes what I want and where my skills align just became available. But im worried that i may come across as a job hopper if they were to look at my LinkedIn. I specify that it's an internship, but i'm worried HR would still red flag me. 

Would it be better to just stick it out with my current job to show that I can ,despite the potential opportunity cost of working somewhere else?

I've been working at a startup in its very early stages for about a year and a half. This is my first job and most of my experience consists of writing and maintaining the front-end of a mobile app using a cross-platform framework that there barely is any demand in the market for. 

I mainly took the job out of desperation in the middle of Covid, with the hope of getting enough experience to then find something somewhere more established and stable. But now looking at job postings I feel like the experience I'm getting at my job isn't really doing me any favors, and almost feels like I'm pretty much in the same place as a year and a half ago, arguably even worse because I don't have access to those ""Entry level"" or ""New Grad"" postings anymore. I've been applying for Front-end positions, but most of those are catered to Web, which I'm definitely open to but don't have the relevant professional experience for on my resume (React, etc.).

Does anyone have any advice of what I should do going forward? Should I start projects with more relevant tech stacks? Or focus solely on LeetCode?

I was the only DevOps resource at the company and so I had no choice but to become knowledgeable in all areas of DevOps and SRE.

And being the only DevOps resource, I finally got burnt out and found an SRE position with a new company where I would be part of an SRE team. I am about a month into being here and I'm seeing some red flags:

* Terraform projects do not follow the OSS community standardized folder structure. 
* Terraform projects are extremely flat and it is seriously overwhelming to not only find, but then to modify the resource you want.
* No usage of Terraform modules, not even publicly available ones. 
* Kubernetes manifests can be applied directly from a local machine. I know it can be annoying to have to commit to a repository for the manifests to be picked up by the automated deployment system and applied, but it is best practice to do so. 
* Tech lead likes to say things along the lines of that we own the infrastructure as team, but then goes on to essentially say ""implement this, this way because I said so"".
* There was a conversation about having the build pipeline ignore something because it could only be known at run time. To me, this was a clear sign to split the repository because there were two different concerns happening (one was dependent on the other). The other team members seemed to be fine with letting the build pipeline ignore that until run time. I know I wouldn't feel comfortable clicking merge on something that isn't known until run time. Luckily, the tech lead agreed with me.
* Tech lead told me to undo something I did because the other Terraform repositories do not follow that pattern. There is literally no pattern that exists currently. Each Terraform repository is done differently. I think he should have come from the angle of using the change I had implemented as a reason to create a new jira ticket on defining what the Terraform repositories should look like going forward.
* There are Cloud Architects, but they are not embedded within the Infrastructure team. From what I have gathered so far, their only job is to design and then hand that off to us or to an app team. We (the infrastructure team) are at their mercy on what the design looks like. 
* The Cloud Architects aren't even following best practices such as environment isolation.

I also happened to join the team at a time when several new contractors were joining. I've been able to jump in quickly and start contributing and getting things done. The new contractors joining is a different story. I don't think it is to say that they suck, I think it is more due to my experience of 3 years having to manage the entire DevOps pipeline myself. I don't think I realized it when I was interviewing to leave my previous company, but I think I am operating at a tech lead level. 

I have a high standard for not only my work, but for the entire DevOps pipeline as a whole. My new company is doing a lot of cool things (similar to what I was doing at my previous company), but the implementation of it is well below my standard. 

So with me being a new hire and not a tech lead, should I stay here and try to convince the team to change their ways, or should I just begin my search again, but for a tech lead position? It seems like it may be more difficult to convince them than what it's worth as I'm not invested into the company yet nor do I have a title that would give me the respect out of the box from people that I know what I'm talking about?

I think this has been mentioned before in this sub, but would interviewing while I've only been at my current position for a month be a turn off to potential employers?

I've so far been rejected from most larger companies. Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, despite doing a ton of prep.

I feel I really missed out. I feel like I missed the easiest and biggest chance to propel my career but now I'm just stuck waiting to hear back from companies. These larger company internships are also extremely beneficial because they provide you with great mentors, and the whole thing is *supposed* to be a teaching experience. And if they like you, you get return offer. And I'm going to miss out on all of that. When you get accepted to an internship, it's because you have potential. When you get accepted into a job, it's because they know you'll bring value to them.

Long story short, my team stresses me out so much.

I graduated this spring and have been working as a developer at a \~super large company\~ for 3 months. I've always loved coding, I had great grades in college, led a CS related club, went to hackathons, all of it.

I got placed on a team that I was excited about, and then got moved to an ""understaffed"" dev team that needed more help. Everyone on both the product and dev teams is at least a decade older than me, so I feel weird sometimes as a 22yo sitting in zooms with like 20 people over 35 all the time.  At the beginning my team didn't have any documentation and threw together an onboarding plan for me. I'm working with a tech stack that I am not familiar with.  I feel stupid and like a burden asking them so many questions when they're all swamped with other things, but there is no reason why I should have learned any of this in college, it's pretty specific to the company. The dev team is always fighting with product, and I got caught in the crossfire today when a product manager got angry at me before asking nicely why something wasn't working. It was something I completed, tested, and even verified with a teammate but turns out I missed a step in the process of pushing that thing to production, as I am, again, unfamiliar with the process in my company and still learning. It was actually a simple fix, and I am angry that this person got angry with me.

My team often works to 7PM even on Fridays. I'm friends with a couple of the other new grads at my office. Their teams are super laid back, they're the last on their team to leave the office at 3:30PM on the Friday before a holiday weekend like Labor Day, and generally they seem a lot less stressed than me.

In university I did little programming (mainly C++ and assembly), so I don't have much experience.

I worked in a software development company for 3 months, but they told me that I can't continue to work for them because I learn pretty slowly and they can't afford to pay me without delivering some useful software (It's understandable because they are a small company). To be honest, I'm not upset at all, because I'm aware of my low knowledge level at this point.

As for what I learnt, I spent two weeks on a beginner python course, which was pretty good at making me understand the basic syntax and concepts. But it's not enough because the tasks that were given to me require python libraries and frameworks knowledge and a good problem solving thinking, which I don't have at the moment.

 I felt overwhelmed by the amount of new things that I should learn in a short time. In addition to that, sometimes I have difficulties even with basic python concepts, so I'm clearly not prepared.

I can live pretty well a few months with the money I saved, so I was thinking about spending those months studying python and getting better at programming in general, to be able to get an entry level job in software development.

The thing is I really like to program and I would love to make a career out of it, but at this moment I'm clearly not ready. I was thinking about applying for different jobs in IT, but I'm not sure that's a good choice right now, because I'll encounter the same problems again.

What should I do ?

The biggest problem was that they changed our insurance and after that point I struggled for over a year to get the mental health help I need, but kept hearing no new patients, we don't take that insurance anymore, and etcetera. Regular health stuff was fine, it just didn't work at all for any psychiatrists or counselors within 25 miles. (I live in a city and that was a totally absurd situation because there isn't any special shortage of them.) I was deteriorating badly and I needed to leave so I could get my mental health taken care of.

So. Around the end of September, I started at the new job. I signed up for new health insurance (best option available, the price is worth it for how much healthcare I need) which started October 1st. I finally got to see someone today, and I will be starting medication hopefully by early next week.

So far so good. Except that I have been struggling really hard learning the new code base, customs, and styles without that medication, and it shows. Once I start back on medication, it will take 4-8 weeks to have me fully back up to speed. I think that if I hadn't lived through over a year of bare knuckling my mental health problems, during a global pandemic no less, I wouldn't be in quite as bad shape as I am now. Alas.

I am, I believe reasonably so based on how much trouble I'm having getting PRs up, extremely scared that I'm going to get fired before I can get better. I have an upcoming chat with someone in HR but I'm not sure what to say. Telling someone is probably better than saying nothing at all, but I don't know what kind of support to ask for.

My issue is PTSD, and that's been confirmed by several doctors over the years, and just to be thorough I also had a full psych eval done, which showed, yes, I definitely have very bad PTSD.

I've gotten really good at helping people develop as leaders, line themselves up for promotion, and navigate job family changes. I really love that part of my job.   


But I'm really tired of managing projects, reporting on goal progress, creating resource estimates and negotiating with other managers. I'm happy to coach others on doing it well, I just don't really want to keep doing it myself.  


I see a ton of people seeking guidance and perspective on tech careers here and in related subs. It really seems like a way I could continue to feel useful and continue to help people succeed in this industry. It would also give me some much needed space and flexibility. 

But is it something people would be willing to pay for? I'm certain most of my clients would come out ahead financially. I don't have any delusions of making as much money as I do now. That's fine. But I think it's important to value my time and ensure that the people I'm working with are committed and invested in the process and practice.
