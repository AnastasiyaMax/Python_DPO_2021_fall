I am a CS student who is living in a country which is not the US and would appreciate some advice on my situation. I have full working rights to go the United States (won't need sponsorship or anything) and would be excited to work there in the near future. My issue I think is that because I have lived outside of the US my whole life and I don't go to well-known school + don't have a US address, I believe its hindering my ability to get OAs/past the resume stage. 

I guess the biggest factor currently bothering me is even when I don't get resume rejected/ghosted and I ""pass"" an OAs (with what I think are decent to optimal solutions), I still get rejected. I am also in the process of redoing my CV based on the advice I see online. 

I have been interning  since last month at a super cool company that is well-known in my country but doesn't have much of a global reach. I have loved working here so far. So I definitely see a path where after my internship I work full-time at this company as I'm learning heaps and I definitely have become a much better developer.   

As I have almost completed my degree in three years, I could graduate in May '22. But I am allowed to push out my graduation to May '23 (take ""a gap year""/with 1-2 chill classes), I am nowhere near perfect at LC/System designs so I could really use the time to get really good and I am lucky to be in a position where my parents fully support me, regardless.

So I was wondering what the best path forward to land a software development role in the United States?  Should I essentially graduate rn and work full-time at a cool company in my home country and bet that I'll get more interest after I get 1-2 years of real work experience OR push back my graduation to May '23, work part-time (I have been offered part-time work at the company) and grind DSA till I'm a god, with the hopes of better luck?

TLDR: CS major with full working rights in the USA, living in random country struggling to get US company OAs, etc. Should I push back my graduation with the hopes of getting a new grad offer next cycle or work a year or two at a company in my home country?

First off, my (21M) academic situation is a bit special. I am from Spain and two years ago I started an associate's degree (not really but something similar which in Spain is called Higher Technician Diploma) in Computer Programming. I didn't want to go study a BSc in Computer Science because I was burnt out from highschool and it seemed everyone was following the same path (fun fact, one of my then friends went into the there and recently abandoned it because it was too much to handle). 

So, there is a thing called dual studies, in which you, as a student, get to work during your second year of associate's while studying, both part time. I went into a big consultancy firm as a paid intern for the first year and then I remained there for another year as a junior backend developer after getting my associate's, so, tadda! I have two years of experience in my field.

Then, life happened and I really needed a change, so I quit my job and, using my savings I came to Denmark to get a Bachelor's of Arts in Software Development as a Top-Up degree (two years instead of four). It's been two months and I already have a job as a junior backend developer again, this time at a start-up, so things are going really well, but I have had this feeling this whole time that I am not really that interested in web development (which I usually find to be what I qualify for)

I've always been the type to like science and math. When I was a kid instead of meeting with my friends I was coming home to do physics and maths exercises off the internet as a hobby. I've always been interested in low level programming (embedded systems, assembler, graphics computation, game engine programming etc.) I can watch so many videos of The Cherno in an evening and have even tried learning OpenGL and how the GPU pipeline works. In my associate's we had a teacher which gave us hard assignments to complete, like implementing our own cipher to a client-server chatting app we made from scratch using sockets, and we had to manage how many packages we sent at a time because the encrypted data was much larger than the raw one, everyone hated him but I loved every second of that subject. However, I feel I miss so many scientific concepts to be able to understand everything I want to do completely.

I don't like what I'm studying right now, everything is focused on enterprise software, managing large systems, test suites and, don't get me wrong, I think it's very useful, but I think I won't ever be able to work in more niche jobs as the previously mentioned ones with my qualifications and experience. I was thinking of going back to Spain once I finish my Bachelor's here and start a BSc in Computer Science, but that would mean not having time to work and, being 23 at that time with maybe 4 years of web development experience (and little to no money because of how expensive Copenhagen is), starting an academic life again would probably be detrimental to my career, especially being in the same field.

I am not very eloquent, so bear with me. I am currently in my fifth year (fourth as a computer science student) at a good school I worked hard to get into. I suffer from clinically severe obsessive compulsive disorder (not to be confused with obsessive compulsive personality disorder). I don't want to make this post super long because I really do need help and advice and don't want people to skip over it, so I'll explain it briefly. I suffer from its effects all day everyday and I'm not being superlative. I'm not trying to get anybody to feel bad for me--I just want to make it clear that it has a huge effect on me hour by hour of every day. That being said, I have particularly bad obsessions and compulsions specific to school. As a result I have a 2.01 GPA and am only a Junior. My school temporarily suspends students if their GPA falls below a 2.00. I wouldn't say I am particularly smart, but my bad grades are not from misunderstanding material or from poor work ethic. 

Just so you know what it is like sort of day to day I'll give an example of an OCD compulsion. Feel free to skip this paragraph if you understand OCD. Obsessions and compulsions rarely make sense. When I was a kid I had this obsession that my parents would die in a plane crash. I got it after my parents had flown somewhere. They weren't planning on flying anywhere anytime soon, but I still had the obsession. This led to a variety of compulsions. One of my mild ones was opening my bedroom door. If I didn't turn it at the correct speed and with my body in the right configuration (right stance, arm angles, where my head was pointing, etc.) then it would result in my parents dying in a plane crash. So I would spend literal hours doing this (sometimes until my skin had become raw) until it felt right at which point I could leave. I have a lot of equally ridiculous and more harmful compulsions and obsessions related to school and schoolwork. 

I have bad OCD ""episodes"" that last several weeks/months and, despite all efforts, usually derail my school semester. I have been a full time student during the pandemic and have only earned three credits (I dropped out of my other classes via petition). I haven't mentioned it yet, but I have very good doctors and specialists who help me a lot. I am medicated and regularly do exposure and CBT therapy, but it's just no match for my constantly changing, severe condition. I don't just suffer from school-related OCD. The pandemic has been particularly rough on my mental health because of my contamination OCD.

I really, really want to graduate, but I feel like I am so far behind everybody. I am almost 25. I know that is not super bad and that people make it at all ages, but I have been at school for five years and I feel like I have made no progress. All my friends from when I started in my program are now graduating and have these great jobs and they all wonder why I am still a junior. I feel like even if I finish then I am going to show up to a job interview and they will be freaked out about why it took me so long to graduate. I really enjoy computer science, but I feel like a fool.

Does that make any sense ? Is it feasible ?

\--------

I'm graduating next semester and the two obvious options are 1) go on to grad school or 2) find a job. 

**1) Grad school :** I'm really sick of being in school (changed majors once), taking exams, and being broke. I'm 2 months into my senior year and I'm already feeling miserable (like every year). An incentive is that higher degrees seem to lead to higher paying jobs / being more employable, and older people around me keep saying to ""get as much education in as you can, while you can"".

**2) Full-time job :** I don't feel like I want to commit to a company immediately after graduating (even if it's just 1-2 years). I want to learn a lot and become good at my job (read: more employable for future jobs), and to finally have money. Also I keep thinking what if the company looks good on my resume but is a nightmare to work at ? Job-hopping right out of college is not desirable, right ?

For context: I don't have any internships on my resume. I've applied to 60-ish Summer 2022 internships, gotten 7 rejections so far and interviewing for 5 currently. Doing another application round in January when more positions open.

Also given the following points:

1.) Tech Culture. I don't care about diversity, ethnically speaking nor economically. I could really care less about being around this ethnic group or that artist, or this or that bartender.  I am fine with how things are in SF. As an engineer I am a king, and the rest of the city supports us.  That's fine. I prefer to be immersed in the tech hierarchy.

2.) Outdoors. I could care less about being outdoors, this is something I look forward to living in New York. I want a concrete jungle with people who work hard and play hard.

3.) Fashion. I don't care about dressing up nice, wearing suits. SF is great because I can wear a t shirt and jeans, and if I want to brag I'll wear some company swag. I don't need to pretend to look good for other people

4.)  People. Besides the lunatic drug addict homeless folks I really like the demographics here. Let's just say I enjoy being surrounded by Asian girls. New York doesn't seem to have the sheer amount, and although they have Dominicans or Puerto Ricans or whatever else, I simply am not interested. 

5.) Pace. I want fast paced, the faster the better. Honestly I'd move to Hong Kong but can't right now. 

Should I be in San Francisco or New York?

Background.

I've seen the inundation of posts asking about locations but I can't seem to find what I need. I want to know if ANYONE feels the same way as I do or can at least help point me in the right direction. 

I'm a software engineer making more than enough (280k base) to live in SF or NYC, so cost of living isn't an issue.

I have been applying constantly on different platforms such as Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice and my schools job portal. I haven’t had any luck with interviews that were promising. I keep getting an answers from either short term contract jobs or companies where they put you in a training period and find you contract positions where you constantly relocate with little to no relocation assistance. I currently live in New York City and would not mind relocating if there is a good relocation package.

In the end I was curious what job portals or methods have you guys found success in to find a permanent position. I have been getting handed a lot of losses lately and it’s just getting frustrating at this point.

I started my career in software 20 years ago. Like some of you, I started in entry-level positions, working the Support queue, answering phones, etc. Over the next 12 years I steadily moved up the skill ladder, working in web startups doing Systems Analysis, Quality Assurance, and finally ended up managing the Engineering group for a year where I was originally hired on as a tester.

I've never had much formal CS training, other than the fact that my (single) Mom was a Developer from when I was quite young, I still the BASIC and LOGO classes she required me to take in school. I've always felt I've done my best learning on-the-job.

I left the software industry nine years ago and started my own company in a completely different business space. There were many, many reasons for this. I was burned out, honestly. My mom passed away. I was a new (single) parent myself, having just ended my marriage. I had dreams of running my own business, and not only did the time seem right, this would allow me the opportunity to have a real relationship with my son. To be the kind of Father I wanted to be.

I enjoyed quite a bit of success. Nine years later the business is sold, and I feel like the pragmatic thing to do is re-enter the field of Software Engineering. 

I wouldn't really say I have a passion for software, or tech in general. Working with the tools can be very satisfying, the ends to which they are put ...depends. I'm not the type of person who would necessarily build apps for fun. 

So, I've been sending out resumes for almost two months now, and getting what feels like not much traction. A few bites, automated ""phone interviews,"" online skill assessments. Applying mostly for entry and mid-level QA positions, because I've got years of experience and this seems like a good place to start.

I'm writing all of this in hopes of eliciting some feedback. Are my expectations unrealistic? Am I being too impatient? I'm a little light on coding experience, and the UW Python Programming &amp; Automation coursework looks very interesting to me, though 6+ months of coursework feels like a long time &amp; like I said, I'm much better at on-the-job learning, it just seems like this opportunity may not soon present itself. I'm skeptical of many of these ""coding bootcamps"" but maybe that's unwarranted?

On a day to day basis, I find that the work that I enjoy the most is when I'm coding some programs on SQL, SSIS, VBA or Python or when I'm discussing database architecture with our IT team. I am now thinking maybe redirecting my self into a computer science program. 

The big question is now how would I be able to land a job as an IT dev. Do I need to go back to school to get a degree in software engineering or can I just take some online classes on the side while working as an actuary?

Also what would be my expected salary as new junior dev in the canadian market? and what would be my expected salary 3-5 years down the road? I am bit concerned if it make sense salary wise as I'm making around 100K + bonus per year and still have growth potential through promotions.

I have an interview  for a position the company calls a Data Manager/Content Manager. The company is a startup  in San Fran. They've been around since 2016. I see that Data Managers in San Francisco make \~$90K/year.

This would be my first job at a tech startup. The company is looking for a rare set of skills which I happen to have. They need someone with knowledge in the architecture/construction industry + database development, plus some willingness to learn front-end development, which I am pretty knowledgeable about as I freelance making websites form time to time.

I went to school to study architecture therefore most of my experience has been in the construction/design industry. Since I began working at my current construction company I have been also doing an online bachelors in CS. That's when I proposed to my current company to migrate our estimating department from using Excel to using MySQL. I basically uprooted the whole department. I have now been the sole database guy at the company for about 2 years. 

I did all of this on my own and there are no other tech people at this job, so the system is not perfect but it works. I am sure there is so much I can learn from a company that is tech focused.

That's what brings me to the question, I roughly have what their looking for but i have never worked at a tech company. I'm sure my code could improve and my so could my practices. I am wondering what I would be worth to a company like this.

These are their requirements.

Also, considering my Resume, should I list this work experience as a 'Research Assistant', what my official title is, or 'Software/Web Developer', what I technically do? I'm going to look for the jobs in web development soon.

I hit off well with all these companies:

- Java role
    - Stable (company runs critical infrastructure and has been around for a long time)
    - Solid benefits
    - Solid mentoring (got along really well with the team lead)
    - Some CI/CD, React/Angular.js, Java/Groovy/Spring Boot/Gradle
 - Startup
    - Golang, React.js/Vue, Node.js, Python, .NET (and a bunch of other stuff)
    - Cloud-heavy (AWS/Azure/GCE)
    - Good connections and solid senior devs
    - Growing really quickly + modernizing
    - Probably not as much ""hand-holding"" + faster-paced
- Consulting
    - Work-life balance
    - Could be a mixed bag really... Not sure what to expect

Consulting is at the bottom of my ""list"", but these choices are still pretty close. My perceptions of these roles are:
- Java role: Surefire entry into dev industry + mentoring + solid Java exp. leads to solid job prospects
- Growing startup: modern, lots of connections (talented guys leaving their F500 seats), ""hotter"", cool people
- Consulting: flexibility, exposure, WLB

All positions pay similarly. What do? I can't go wrong with the Java-based role, but jumping into a ""hotter"" stack might pay off 10+ years down the line. Is even consulting worth it?

There is folk with \~ 6 months YOE who seems to be very enthusiastic during the onboarding process, when introduced himself to the team, he also said things like: ""I will try my best to fit in asap"", ""I am very willing to learn"", etc... In fact, he was hired from a much less prestigious company and his TC was probably boosted by at least 2 times.

Fast-forward, after the generic onboarding process, he joined his 1st sprint, I was assigned to supervise and help him. I quickly realized some problems, he has 0 experience of the framework we are using as he claimed in his resume, he put the line ""strong experience in XXX"" but in fact, he was exposed to it by doing some small projects. He cant even solve a git merge conflict. 

I was fine with all of those things, I was sending him tutorial links, and kept answering his questions and encouraging him to ask whenever he is in trouble, I also tried to allocate time to him to learn the tech-stack and not assign any task to him except 1 fixing bug, introductory ticket, which I could do in 30 minutes.  

During all of the daily-stand up he always reported that he is looking at component xxx/reading yyy, some of those aren't making any sense (I already pointed the code which he should read, and tell him to learn the structures of the API from high- level stand-point), if he tries to look at everything it is impossible as none in our team knows all of the system.

Then suddenly, he's gone missing. No slack/email response, I tried to call him once and was able to reach him, he just told me that he is sick and sorry and just hang up immediately. After that, he seemed to block my phone number.

I don't know if he has any personal problems or he has some problems with me, I was new to this training new hires responsibility and I really wanted him to fit in, I never publicly criticised him or even had a harsh tone at him.

I'm a Software Engineering Manager in Canada and my LinkedIn profile is pretty solid. A recruiter from a Silicon Valley startup in hyper-growth mode reached out to see if I'd be interested in exploring an Engineering Manager opportunity with them. I agreed and found out that the work was right up my alley (dev tool development and building a React component library, similar to Material UI - both things I have past experience with). The hiring manager (Senior EM) specifically picked me on LinkedIn because my past experience aligned really well with what they needed and after meeting him, it sounded like a great fit. He told me they would basically give me the ""white glove treatment"" and it all sounded great.

Next up was the meeting with the recruiter about salary expectations, but instead of asking me what my expectations were, she told me what they were offering. When I found out how much they were offering, my jaw hit the floor. It was a life-changing amount of money - like triple my current yearly income - while also being fully remote. It almost sounded too good to be true, but of course I agreed to proceed with the interviews. However, I was also interviewing with other companies during this time as well, and the next day I had an offer from another company that was basically on par with my current income, but had much better career growth potential and more interesting work. I let the first company know that I had another offer on the table and asked if it would be possible to expedite the interview process since I didn't want to reject my current offer as it was still a good opportunity (and would get me out of my current job, where I'm bored and miserable). 

The next day, the recruiter did exactly that and got the full interview panel lined up over the following 2 days. She called me up and literally told me exactly how the interviews would play out and what questions I would be asked so that I could prepare. Unfortunately the hiring manager I met earlier was on PTO that week, so he wouldn't be part of the interview panel. I took the interview super seriously, got in touch with my mentor to run through the questions to understand how best to answer them, and I spent hours prepping. I had 5 interviews lined up - People Management, Execution, Product Management, Systems Design, and Hiring Manager. Every interview went down exactly as the recruiter said they would and I had great conversations with everyone. It all seemed to go very well... except for the Systems Design one. I prepared for something very different than the challenge that was actually provided to me, which threw me off guard. I thought I did okay, all things considered, but I was being interviewed by a Staff Engineer who had me design a full back end architecture for something I had never done before (and my experience and passion is more on the Front End side of things).

The next morning, the interview panel met to debrief, and then the recruiter called me to let me know that the panelists all really liked me, but ultimately they would not be extending me an offer. Sounded like a few of my answers didn't quite hit the mark (in retrospect, I realized at least one of my answers could have been presented much better), and the Systems Design portion didn't hit home. I thanked her and expressed genuine gratitude for the opportunity, but also let her know that the Systems Design portion threw me off guard and that it was very different than what she said it would be. She apologized and said that wasn't supposed to happen and she would take that feedback back to the panelist. I emailed the original Hiring Manager and thanked him as well for the opportunity and that it was a shame we won't get to work together. I've now signed the contract with the other offer and will move forward with that one.

So here's the thing. I almost wish they didn't tell me how much the job was offering, because thinking about that kind of life-changing income (I could be debt free in 3 months instead of 3 years, I could actually buy a house in this ridiculous housing market, etc) added a lot of pressure and makes the sting of losing this opportunity that much more painful. I've never heard of any company offering that much income outside of maybe Facebook, while also being a job that aligns so well with my skillset, while working with really smart and capable people. 

Are those kinds of opportunities as rare as I think they are or were they simply out of reach before the pandemic (since now so many companies are going remote first)? Is this just a bump in the road and jobs like this could come again in the future, or have I missed out on something amazing that may not come again?
