&amp;#x200B;

I graduated from an ivy last year with a bio&amp;soc degree and am currently doing research in spine surgery and studying for the mcat. I think I am going to do pretty well and my volunteering etc. is probably good enough to get me into a decent medical school.

 However, I am increasingly realizing that the thought of going through years of medical school and residency fills me with a sense of loss of free time. 

I have a group of 8 friends from high school who literally have all gone into computer science (or 1 into data science). 

My current plan is to try and get into a less time-intensive residency like psychiatry, which sounds extremely interesting to me. However, the thought of going through medical school still doesn't appeal to me and I don't want to take on the debt and risk of not getting into a specialty which makes me happy.

I suppose my question is: how hard is it to pivot into a career in computer science given my bio degree from Cornell? Will my degree be useful to the process at all?

Everything is nice except for one thing: I'm not getting paid. I didn't really mind because I realized it was sort of impossible to find somewhere which offered pay so I didn't have a problem with it.

Two weeks ago the owner (boss of my boss) asked me to have a meeting. It was basically to checkup on how I'm doing, if I've been having any trouble or needed help, etc. At the end he said that they're in need of a jr. programmer and that he's been getting good reviews from me so he was thinking of hiring me but wanted to know my opinion, he even offered to be part-time while I finish uni.

Based in western Europe. Mostly working remote, not in a tech hub, the choice to get this particular job in this particular location was intentional as it best suits my other current plans at this time. I've been working at my current company for over a year-ish now, and I got the job as a self-taught Dev with prior freelancing experience (working on getting an actual degree atm since I feel this holds me back...). So this is not my first job, but everything I've done prior has been smaller scale projects/freelance type jazz, not anything I could really classify as ""enterprise level software engineering"", and always a bit of a mix of everything. 

The other day, I asked my manager for a raise (as I've been here for a while, have started taking up many more kinds of tasks than initially, involved in hiring people/evaluating skills of people at early-to-mid level degree or not, and people [SWE colleagues, team lead, PMs, manager] have been happy with my work fairly consistently all the way through), but was told that currently there is no budget for raises, and that the company works with yearly/2-yearly budget allocations during which they decide who will get raises. 

I was a bit surprised by this since I've been told they (only) do raises ""after a year"", and had the impression that that would literally imply we could sit down for that discussion right after a year if everything was going well. Afterwards he reassured me that he thinks I deserve a raise and that he's really bound by this budgeting system. All this I found to be pretty confusing.


If I compare my salary to some salary averaging websites locally, I see that my salary is below the average for somebody with 1 y/o experience. 
I'm not sure if my past activities are to give me any experience credit at all. Compared to other salary info for people working here publically available on, say, Glassdoor, they also earn significantly more than me with the same job title.

I do find the job I have to be quite easy. That is, it's not fundamentally and objectively very easy, it's not making little CRUD apps for tiny companies anymore. I can and have seen some kinds of people struggling with this sort of job, but it's not the hardest thing in the world either -- the majority of my colleagues have various kinds of CS degrees, too. I never particularly had an issue following along with the degree-havers, in fact, there have been plenty of times where I suggested or knew about some CS topic better than somebody with a CS degree. I'm quite invested in the CS field for personal-interest reasons.

I also find it fundamentally quite unrewarding to work on easy (to me) things, I'm very much running into the same issue doing a degree course aimed at people who've never touched programming/computers and can't do logical thinking/problem solving. But my job is laid back position and it allows me to work on the degree problem until that is resolved. 


Should I be worried about this situation? Are they simply trying to exploit me for cheaper work because of the lack of degree? I really want to max my ""worth"" as a SWE, even given my current situation without messing up the degree story. Is it worth attempting to job hop within such an area given my own self-imposed limitations? 


Of course an obvious solution is to simply get to a tech hub and/or try to get into big tech companies (and I'm thinking of doing that longer-term) but currently I'm quite stuck to my current location.

I had my technical interview with the startup company's developer team on 9/17, then a brief interview with its CTO on 9/27 to answer any questions I had regarding the position. I still have to go through a final behavioral interview with someone from the parent company, and the person I'll be interviewing with will make the final hiring decision.

On 10/5, an HR representative from the parent company told me that I'm the top candidate for this position at the startup and that they're very interested. She asked me for a salary requirement. The job listing stated they're looking for someone between 2-5 years of experience and also provided a very large salary range ($70k - $150k IIRC), which I'd assume would vary depending on years of experience. 

I consulted a few friends who already have developer jobs and they all suggested that I ask for $95k annual salary, which one of my friends predicts would likely be countered with -$5-10k of my ask. They all agreed that it's on the higher end of the salary range they'd likely agree to, but not so ridiculous that I'd be rejected from consideration. I'm currently going through the interview process with a few other companies, so I sent an email mentioning that, but also said I'm most interested in this position and think it would be a great fit on both ends. 

I thought it was strange that they asked for my salary requirement before I even had my final interview because I'm under the impression that it's typically asked after they decide they want to hire you. My optimistic side wants to believe they've already decided they want to hire me, but that's probably unlikely.

A few days after the salary requirement email, I didn't receive an email with details for the last interview, so I sent the CTO a follow-up email. He told me he's going to try to set up a meeting with the person who'll be running the last interview and get back to me on 10/8. I didn't hear from him on that day, so I sent another follow-up email to see what's up. He told me he's trying to set up a final interview sometime this week, but it's already Thursday and I still haven't received an email from them.

I'm a bit concerned about the status of my application there since the final interview has been delayed for quite some time. I don't think reaching out to the CTO a third time would look good on my end since that would probably give the impression that I'm desperate for this job, causing me to lose compensation leverage. I'm not exactly sure how candidacy priority works, but my pessimistic side thinks they could've decided to postpone my final interview in favor of other candidates with lower salary requirements.

On the other hand, giving them the benefit of the doubt, I think a reason why the process is taking so long because they were only recently acquired and are still figuring out the best way to integrate with the parent company. The CTO also mentioned that I'll be the first one to go through this interview process during my interview with him, so figuring out the process on their end is another reason for the delays.

Hey Guys, Hope you’re well. I was an Solution Engineer. 

So I wanted to get advice as I’m kind of in an odd position. Google is something I’ve wanted for years, this job specifically:

https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/121781000507138758/

I was wondering what you’d recommend for me to educate myself on the side after hours to build up my technical skill set more so I’m better qualified for this position in the future…specifically the AI/cloud tech and data architectures that I don’t have much experience with. Otherwise I check all the boxes, except for the 10 year minimum, but that will come with time. 

Any courses, certificates, etc anything at all as this is the position I’m working towards. Professionally this is my biggest goal/dream so I’m just trying to figure out what’s the smartest way of going about it.

Offer A is from a startup with about 100 employees that just received a huge series A round (making them almost a unicorn) and offer B is from Google.

To give some more background, eventually my goal is to start a company or be in a senior role at a promising startup.

That being said, here are what I see as the pros of each offer.

Offer A:

- Product is awesome and I would love to work on it.
- Team is awesome
- Get more responsibility early in career
- Get to interact with successful founders and learn directly from them
- Equity in company would be worth a lot if it goes public (although I know this is unlikely so I’m not really considering this point)

Offer B:

- More money in the short term. Obviously Google is going to pay more but company A is offering enough (150 not counting equity) that this isn’t such a motivating factor for me.
- Work is good enough but I’ll feel like a face in the crowd. I got matched with the search team which I’m very interested in but day to day working at a huge company doesn’t excite me as much.
- Become a better engineer? Although I’m not convinced as much about this one because the scope of my job will be more limited and Company A has a good team.
- Clout/exit opportunities?

If the decision was just based on the work alone, I would choose the startup. My main worry is that I’m giving up an opportunity later to have ‘SWE at Google’ on a resume.

Team works beyond office hours (WFH) as daily stand-up meeting with offshore team is in late evening. I feel obliged to do the same, leaving me with no personal time at all. Too exhausted to do anything on weekends cuz I'm working 12 hours a day, 60+ hours a week. What do I do?


Background info: started out in a big company and left in five months cuz if toxic management. Joined a wonderful startup as a data engineer but I barely get any time left to live. 


My team (of around 12 people) is really wholesome, we have a amazing engineers and really challenging work (a lot of physics. Fun but it has its downsides).


Here's my issue. We have daily stand-up meetings and being an international team with members working in different offices (currently WFH), we have a common meeting, that's late evening, my time. After my official work hours. Ideally, we can just log off and then just attend the meeting when it happens but my team just stays on and works. Like, work ends at 6pm. Meeting is at 8. All my teammates stay online, push code, basically work like it's still work hours from 6-8, then attend the meeting for the next two hours. And I feel the need to do the same cuz everyone else is. That leaves me with no time at all. Like, I have dinner at 10 pm most nights cuz those meetings run long because we end up discussing some complicated things. Come weekend, I'm just too exhausted to do anything.


I don't wanna just work and die on a keyboard. I've got plans for future studies, learn the violin, play some games, talk to my girlfriend. Basically, live life. Like, what's the point of just working?


Do you guys have any advice on how to deal with this situation? I just want to be able to live life outside of work.

I am aspiring to be a web developer, starting with front-end. A year ago I followed The Odin Project curriculum mostly halfway through, and I am somewhat knowledgeable with HTML CSS and JS.

This is some of the stuff I was able to do (not mobile friendly yet), so you guys can see where I am at. Nothing back end.

[https://wulfenn.github.io/restaurant/](https://wulfenn.github.io/restaurant/)

I wish to resume now my journey towards becoming a web developer, but I have found that I thrive better under structure, and while learning by myself has served well, I think I would perform well with tutoring and non self-imposed deadlines and such.

Right now I don't have a job, but I do have access to some funds. I foresee being able to put full time learning for around 6 months, then find a side job non related to coding while I finish my studies.

To that end, **do you guys recommend a bootcamp, or getting an associates degree for 2 years?** If so, **which are some of the best options in either?** I am honestly also new to the US so I am not very well aware of which is better. I feel however a bit afraid of bootcamps since from what I have researched most of them hire their own students as teachers and are managed by third party companies unrelated to the university's name. Even so they are faster than actually going to college.

Honestly I would prefer to follow a cheap associate's degree, even if it takes two years. I am just not certain if I can speed that up by putting extra effort and time, and what are some of the best options available online. I am located in NV, but I'd rather do everything online.

I have questions about databases.

1. How does this solution deal with the global database? Because all the instances must have the same ""state"". For example, if I design a load-balanced banking application, I have to make sure that someone can't coordinate a double-withdrawal from both Europe and Asia at the same time. It seems like even if I can parallelize request-handling, each server's SQL mutations are inherently sequential and are a bottleneck.
2. How would I horizontally scale a database? Continually adding compute to a single database has limitations, and I imagine a single instance could become too huge and take too long to query even if it was well-indexed.

I figured I would resign from the tech company and pursue the startup full time if I get an offer, but it just occurred to me that it might be possible to work both jobs, especially since my current job is super laid back.

The majority of these apprenticeship programs take a MINIMUM of 6 months from application to interviews to decisions to starting the actual program. In six months you can literally take 2 bootcamps! If you're like me- stuck in a toxic industry and looking for an out- it's really hellish to sit and wait 6 months. Plus by the time any of these things actually start I may well have done enough self study to make it obsolete. 

In addition to the ridiculous delay a lot of these programs will pay very little or nothing for the first 3-6 months. Not only do you need to be able to weight 6 months, but now you need to be able to survive off of nothing (they all expect you to quit your job) for an extended amount of time. Once the learning process is done you are then given an ‘apprenticeship’ well below the going rate of an intern. 

On top of all that, these programs are few and far between. Applications are super competitive and some people will apply to an application for multiple cycles (so the process is a year plus). With all the long time delays and little to no pay these programs typically end up lending themselves to people with a decent amount of resources anyway. 

I recently spent a full day applying to the REACH linkedin apprenticeship (which to be fair does pay continuously but they do not post their rates). Then after reviewing their website I found “based on a high volume of applications, we will not be able to review every application. However, all applications in this period will have an equal chance of review.” I ended up writing 1700+ words for their application that they maybe will review? If you don’t want to read it all then just have lower word requirements and actually review each application.

All in all these programs are kind of coming off as low effect attempts to try and promote diversity. Realistically you will have a more reliable shot just doing a 6 months of self learning and then finding a contracted job or some low end work. I have spent nearly 6 months applying to every apprenticeship I can find while being open to relocation, and I have applied to all of 3. Two of them haven’t got back to me and one said they aren’t moving forward with my application at this time and to try again in their next round.

I found a 25$/hour 1 year contracting job in Silicon Valley that offers training and tuition supplements. It seems to be very similar to these positions with a high expectation of training, but I would get paid continuously (though 25 is bad in the Bay Area) and with tuition supplements so I can apply for a masters.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a CS major at community college, and I'm considering a minor in Mathematics when I transfer to a four year. I'm currently enrolled in Single Variable Calculus II, and I've really started to enjoy learning math. I'm at the point where I'm looking at what classes to take in the future, and I'm very interested in continuing on to multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and even differential equations. I'm currently planning on just getting my bachelor's and moving on to working, rather than going into grad school/research (although I'd be open to it if I get a chance to be a research assistant and I find that I like it). From what I can tell, the school I'm planning on transferring to (Cal Poly Pomona) only requires math up to calc II, and maybe some discrete math in a CS class, so I was thinking about minoring in math to get some more math classes under my belt. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would a minor in math alongside a CS bachelor's help in any way when it comes time for job searching? And, would the extra experience in math come in handy for a SWE? I'm an independent student (self-supported), so I'm conflicted between just getting my degree and getting to work as fast as possible, and exploring my interests at school.
