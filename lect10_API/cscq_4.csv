Long post ahead. I just turned 25 last month and graduated with a Bachelor's in Biochem in spring 2020. My GPA is a 3.06, so not that great. I wanted to go into healthcare but realized I didn't like it, and I don't want to do anything with biotech or in a lab. I got a job earlier this year at a law firm and am currently assisting a paralegal and secretary with some of their work. I originally took this job because I was literally getting no other offers and there's not much entry-level jobs in my area that aren't sketchy sales, and also because I've always been interested in the legal field.

Turns out that I don't mind this type of work. I don't love the area of law I'm currently in and would pick a different one if I was a lawyer, but I don't think I'd hate the kind of work my attorney does. I've also always been good at reading and writing, so I know I wouldn't be bad at this job. The problem is that you have to go to a high-ranking law school to have good job prospects, and all admissions care about is your GPA and LSAT. I haven't taken the LSAT yet, but my GPA is so low that even with a high LSAT I doubt I'd be able to get into a highly ranked school. The other problem is that I greatly value work-life balance. I read that most lawyers who work 40-hour weeks make very little, and I really don't want to work 60+ hours a week (I also hate billable hours so I can't imagine having to bill 8-12 a day). I'd like to make near six figures at minimum since I still have undergrad loans and will likely need to take out more for law school.

The other path I'm thinking of pursuing is data analytics. I know this probably isn't the best experience to go off of, but I've always enjoyed statistics. I took Biostats in undergrad which is a bit more advanced than your normal high school AP Stats or intro college stats and really enjoyed it. I picked up the math and coding with R pretty quickly. I was passionate and excited about the research project we did at the end where we came up with a topic and had to find our own data to manipulate. I really enjoyed analyzing data to come up with conclusions and seeing how it compared to your hypothesis.

Cons of this path are that I don't know how accurate this experience is compared to working as an actual business/data analyst, if liking college R is indicative at all of whether I'd like coding... and I actually hate math. I enjoy stats and can tolerate algebra, but I hate stuff like calculus and physics and am afraid data science would require that kind of math. I also think it'd be incredibly hard to get an entry-level job without any prior experience, and I'd have to self-teach myself more coding. Why would a company hire me over all of the other grads that actually majored in Comp Sci or MIS and have internships? There is a master's program here in business analytics and MIS, but they're relatively new and cost $35k, so idk if it'll be helpful in getting me a job and be worth the money. At least with law all I need is good grades at a good school to get a job.

I know both fields are saturated right now (isn't everything?) so I'll have to work hard no matter what I choose. But I already screwed up and wasted my time and money in undergrad, so I don't want to make the same mistake. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you guys can give me insight on what working in tech/data is like and if it's the better path for me to take. :)",True,False,False,cscareerquestions,t5_2sdpm,626424,public,self,Should I go into data or law?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qcypzr/should_i_go_into_data_or_law/,all_ads,6,,,,,

All throughout my life I was pushed into special education but my parents refused, which lowered my confidence in mathematics and problem-solving overall.  I am two classes from an applied math degree now.  I can blame all of my problems on other people but honestly I just trying to impress myself, father, and people around me, so even though my mindset has changed I have a difficult time getting into a job.  I ask for $50-60k and even as low as $30-40k but I am always passed over or rejected based upon my criminal record.  For the ""woke"" devs, I was hired at Varsity Tutors for a remote tutoring position in Calc, Linear Alg, and to create a Python curriculum.  Therefore, no I am not assuming this, these are hard stated facts by recruiters and hiring managers, so please take your philosophical, non-suppositional vomit out of here.

My day to day has been mostly working on small features (programming in VB for legacy stuff and C# for newer features) and using the business support platform to help internal staff with technical issues (bugs and stuff they encounter trying to use the internal system).

Recently we got switched back to office-based, which has sucked for me as my commute is 3-4 hours total a day depending on traffic. I considered moving closer but I'm really not even enjoying the job at all. If anything, it made me realise that programming isn't something I really want to do for the rest of my life. What I did enjoy from the job however was figuring out why things were breaking, helping internal staff with their issues and working with other departments of the business to figure out what they want added/changed (turning their thoughts into items that we can actually implement).

I resigned recently so that I could take a step back and really think about where to go next. I've wanted to pivot into roles that are in the tech field but not just coding 24/7 and QA has seemed really appealing to me. I like the idea of working WITH devs to help test/fix the system rather than being a dev myself. I also enjoy communicating with people and think I could do well in a role where I get to interact with people and help them understand things. However, the vast majority of the entry level QA jobs I've seen so far have required 1+ year of testing experience.

I am about to finish an associates degree (2y) on System Administration and Networking. Also planning on starting   engineering career on IT this year (2022).

Also doing an internship as Support Specialist, and im not enjoying the job so far to be honest, since i dont have the oportunity to grow up my skills (or at least the skills i want to grow).

However i am working on development proyects (mostly backend related) by my own, and i plan to seek for developement job oportunities in the near future. I'm also interested about DevOps, but i know this kind of role requires at least some experience, so for now i dont know if it's a good move to mention this.

The point is that, at the moment, i am showing as Junior Sysadmin, and i feel like employers and recruiters won't give a shit about a sysadmin when hiring developers. 

I need advice about this topic, since i would love to work on backend jobs, a mix of servers and databases with development really calls my atention, and im loving it so far on the proyects i am making.

This are the skills i have on my CV, i also have previous experience (about 1.5y) as a Web Content Manager and a few more non it related jobs

* Windows &amp; Linux systems administration 
* Knowledge of Python &amp; Bash scripting
* Knowledge in Networks 
* Knowledge of SQL and Relational Databases 
* Knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS 
*  Knowledge in Git &amp; GitHub 
* Knowledge in Microsoft Azure (Cloud) 
* Notions in Containers (Docker &amp; Kubernetes)

I’m sorry to sound stupid, but I am a majoring in Management Information Systems(MIS) at my local state school, and to be honest I don’t understand the difference between MIS and CS. 

It seems to me, MIS is just dumbed down CS, although I very well could be wrong.

If you have the time to help, I have a few questions:
1. What exactly is the difference in learning between the two curriculums?

2. What are the common job types after getting an MIS degree?

3. What are the pros and cons of MIS vs CS?

Thank you very much for your insight, I am currently determining whether or not to switch to CS and your comments may help lead me down a good path to research further.

I’m hoping some of you have been or are in a similar situation as me. 

For some background, I am a Senior ML engineer at 24yr old. We recently took on a few interns and I have been having trouble finding a way to incorporate them. The interns are recent graduates from good universities with a degree in computer science (some even have masters degrees) 

I find that too much of my time working with them is helping them debug very simple errors.  I know they are fresh into the workplace, but even so it’s been hard to manage.  I am a self taught programmer with a degree in psychology, so when they take days to do something that should only take a few hours it triggers me.  To make it worse I am younger than some of them, so i feel that they are more comfortable approaching me with questions that make them look bad.  

I obviously have been helping them because their success is the company’s success, but I’m starting to lean towards the strategy of not offering help at all.  I am thinking about doing this not out of spite, but because I feel it will help them grow and get better. 

Those of you with interns, do you also feel like a teacher rather than a boss?  If so how do you manage your time?  The goal of getting interns is to manage our workflow not to add more unnecessary work.  Some of the projects they are working on are miscellaneous but the time I am putting into helping them I could’ve done it myself and better.

I am in my first job as a data engineer for a big finance company (household name brand in the US).

The vast majority of my work deals with Scala, Spark, a bit of Python (e.g. for writing lambdas on AWS) and rewriting/migrating on-premises stuff to AWS. Some Java will be used in the near future for working on regular applications in the traditional software engineering sense. I also do production support for the stuff I write and some other things my team is responsible for.

I get to help in redesigning some systems to be cloud-native as well, though I don't think too many people take the suggestions of a junior dev with &lt;1 YOE very seriously.

Contrary to a lot of posts I have seen on here I don't use SQL too much and don't really interact with any databases, so I am not a glorified DBA. I mostly just write pipelines to process big amounts of data coming from some software our company uses and send it to other teams for their consumption automatically.

If I am mostly writing pipelines using Spark, Terraform scripts, Python stuff, actively moving things over from on-premises infrastructure to AWS (and helping rearchitect it), and supporting the pipelines I write in a production environment, is this quality experience for a new grad?

But then otherwise, I don't know. I just feel guilty because everyone on this subreddit says your company does not care about you, but I don't think that applies at all for where I work.

TC in terms of base | RSUs/4yrs | sign-on/relocation

Atlassian (return offer)

* 130k | 150k | 25k
* Flexible WFH policy, but I wanted to move somewhere so I put SF office

Qualtrics

* 105k | 100k | 2.5k (initial offer. currently in negotiations)

Some thoughts so far:

Atlassian

* Interned here this past summer and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My team and mentor were really helpful/nice/cool. It’s not guaranteed I will be placed in the same team, but I also met with some other people outside of my team and everyone was chill/nice/cool
* Career growth (promotions, projects) seems better at Atlassian
* WLB emphasized, unlimited PTO
* Variety of products that are interesting
* Very high cost of living

Qualtrics

* All interviewers emphasized WLB and seem to really like their jobs
* Office in the heart of Seattle
* I am an outdoorsy/active person so the vibes/scenery in Seattle seems more my type
* Not as interesting product(s)?
* Lower cost of living is a huge pro
* Lower TC (especially the bonus) but it might be higher after negotiations. I’m waiting to hear back from HR

I feel like Atlassian &gt; Qualtrics in terms of career growth/stability/prestige/culture but Seattle &gt; SF. However, I’ve never been to either city so that is just my conclusion from the vibes i’m getting.

I want to have fun/meet new people/go out while I’m still young. I also want to grow/move up in my career and maybe eventually move to a less technical role (management maybe?). So I guess i'm hoping for a healthy balance between work + social life

I don’t plan on staying at one company for too long + I feel like I can get the best of both worlds by living in both cities for a few years each but obviously life doesn’t always work the way we plan it

Also small caveat: I already signed with A bc they had a hard deadline. Just received Q offer

I'm a SQL/ETL Developer that works with a lot of ""BI Developers"" that come from the business side and barely know basic SQL. So basically my entire career has been in this environment. You might be asking why I would stay in such a terrible environment? A few reasons:

1. I saw some red flags right away but I was only at my first job out of school for 1 year so didn't want to jump ship immediately again because I thought it would look bad and I wouldn't have time to learn anything. (Even though I saw red flags it took a while to learn the extent of  the problem because everyone I work with is extremely siloed. The job posting was way more ambitious than the job or what the managers intended for the job.)
2. Since I had by far the most technical background I would have opportunities for advancement (This did work out. I have gotten multiple promotions, but it's still within the same team.)
3. Since most people I worked with were much older than me I figure it could only get better as people retire or move on. (This didn't work out. I got a new manager that seems to be doubling down on the terrible environment. I have offered to automate tasks that people on our team do daily that would free up hours weekly,  but she seems hesitant. Not sure if it's because she doesn't understand the solution or doesn't want to take work away from people even if this work should have been automated years ago. She also promoted someone I consider totally incompetent which tells me things will never change. Plus, most people I work with could never get a job with a comparable salary with their skillset elsewhere so they will stay forever.)
4. I had lots of life stuff going on over these 6 years so having a steady job that pays well was fine by me.

So basically everything we do is bad practice and the problems I work on are simple because I am limited by my team. With that new manager I figure it's time to leave but I have been struggling with how to handle interviews. I have done a couple phone interviews so far and have done okay on the technical side, because I have been studying, but I don't know how to handle my past experience. I so far have tried to downplay my previous job or even lie. For example, we use ""Agile Methodologies"" but in reality we have zero structure and totally wing it on every project. During an interview I was asked about using an Agile methodology, and how it works at my current job, and I had to lie based on what I have read about Agile since what we call Agile is basically no structure whatsoever. When asked why I'm looking for a new job I just say I'm looking for new challenges and learn new things but does that sound strange when I'm applying to jobs that, based on experience, are lateral at best?

Earlier this week I had an interview for a small construction company and they’re looking for an engineer to design and deploy an application that will allow their company to keep track of job sites and their associated “tasks” to complete that the supervisor on site can check off as they get completed. Mentioned he wanted reports generated(not sure what they include). 

He mentioned that the reason they’re looking for someone to build this out in house vs getting some sort of existing project management software that exists already is due to the company wanting something to grow as they do. They’ve had something like this in the past, but the previous engineer no longer works there and has not maintained or has the codebase anymore. 

I asked if they have anything related to what they had previously and he said they don’t. But they know exact what they need and believes if we break this down into manageable chunks, this project can be successful. 

I’m nervous due to the fact that I would be the only engineer there. The roll is offering $75k in the Phoenix area. Had a call with him this morning negotiating higher due to the amount of work this is going to be. His whole thing was starting at that number and setting milestones up in order to get a performance bonus. Is this normal? 

Overall, I’m feeling like I can’t do this, but the more I break it down, the more I feel like I can? Like as long as I can break down what needs to get done into small digestible pieces, I should be able to succeed.

Comp at Facebook will be ~250k (but the signing bonus is large) and maybe dip below that for the next year and come up again.

I feel like I can find an interesting team that I enjoy working on at Facebook where I can potentially learn a lot (I would go through the bootcamp process). The work at the finance place seems like a relatively stable 45-50 hr a week and pretty chill (it’s not Citadel). But I don’t think what I’ll be doing/learning is particularly that interesting or cool. It’s going to be relatively finance/firm-specific stuff and building systems to analyze post trade activity.

However, my educational background is not very technical (bachelor's in Business and master's in IS). I fell in love with Data Science and ML during my master's. That's when I started coding.

The bottom line is, data science is very complex and I have some educational gaps, especially on statistics and math. I've always liked math and stats but didn't pursue those fields in college. I'm constantly learning on my own and trying to educate myself as much as possible by taking online courses, reading books, and doing personal projects.

I love learning about Data Science and Machine Learning and I'm trying to create a life long habit of learning. I'm already taking online courses and thought about getting an online master's. But I'm wondering if the cost and return would be worth it since I already have a master's degree.

My questions are:

1. Would you recommend pursuing an online master's degree in Data Science while working?
2. Should I just keep working, save money, and learn on my own?
3. Do you think it is worth it getting a PhD in Data Science after you start working? (not sure if I'd be eligible given my education background or if I'd like to focus on academic research)

I understand the answer to those questions depends on what I want to get out of it.

I've been posting a lot here lately and I would like to thank you all for your advice.Last september I jumped ship and it's not quite what I expected. In a panic I applied somewhere else that felt good.

They've offered me a job but I still wasn't quite sure if this was the job for me. It's at an agency where my former classmates work as well. The company looks fun but I feel that it's more of the same.

I said that I would get back to them today. We've gone through multiple round but I'm still not sure about it. I told him I needed more time and to reflect with myself and other people. He was understandably disappointed but I feel this was the right choice right now. He said that the position could be filled in the meantime. I told him that was my loss and that was fair. I told him that would reach about in about 3-4 weeks when I had the time to talk to a coach. He was unhappy with that.

So, I'm kind of in limbo right now. I'm not sure if I should take the job and delayed the inevitable. Also, I feel like I kind of hurt their trust by asking for time to reflect. I know my panic application wasn't the greatest decision but that's how it is right now.

This person never introduces herself to anyone after she starts, so no one knows who the hell she is. 

So 2 weeks after she starts the job, she decides we are “agile” and changed the following in one day:

-	Our 6 feature teams are breaking up and now they are two teams of 20 each. So daily standups and scrum rituals with 20 people, including 3 PM’s per team. We have to disrupt our team structures, ongoing projects, current sprints, jira projects etc in one day
-	She neglects accounting for our API team and where they will go, says they are “out of scope” (???)
-	We have 3 week sprints instead of 2 now for some reason 
-	Multiple people say this is a bad idea and she tells the team we “made this decision so that's what we are doing”. No SHE made the decision top down. 
-	She got in a heated argument with our head of DevOps in front of the department, keep in mind she has been there for 2 weeks and this he has been there for 3 years

Just pure arrogance and incompetence, and somehow they are randomly my boss’s boss’s boss. Her choices already caused chaos and it's only getting worse.

Basically a list of languages I have no experience in. Confidence levels start going down. So I pick node.js for the practice test because it's written in JavaScript, right? Well, the question is make a CLI that does X! Sounds simple enough but there's a function with taking in an argument called ""lines"" that apparently is coming from something called ""stdin"" and my output should come from ""stdout"" and it's all completely alien to me. Dunno what's going on or how I'm supposed to do it.

Anyway, I had a crack at the first real question picked Python for the language because I learned Python as a complete beginner and it was a very similar question.

English seemed easy, so I searched for a lucrative field with it. That was Law. So I dropped higher-level Maths and got a place in a prestigious London law school.

I have a pair programming interview round, which is the first round of interview of a big European product-based company.

I am an Indian software engineer with 7 years of experience in web development. I have never been in a pair programming round before. I have otherwise attended countless interviews in the last couple of months but have never been in a pair programming round.

It is going to be a 75-minute long interview round. They have asked me to have a coding environment ready that can be screen shared on Google Meet.

Please suggest any tips that you might have. Should I be putting descriptive comments for each part of code as I write or focus on completing the functionality first?

Also, throwaway.

So, I made the career change from TEFL teacher to programming this year. I completed a bootcamp, got my first job with bad pay for a few months, and now I just got a place on a graduate scheme with a big/very big company doing rails backend. Pay is alright, hours and benefits are meh.

I’m only a couple of weeks in but I’m already fighting with a growing feeling that this might not be for me, and I’m wondering what the hell to do.

Firstly, it’s remote. So I’m alone, all day.

Secondly, while I’ve been given a few ‘walkthroughs’ of the project, but I’m still mostly clueless as to how to even start a ticket. I’m a boot camper, and graduate level, but I have been left with the feeling that they expect more from me than I’m capable of. I completed one largely due to my mentor/buddy basically going through it with me (ie, they told me what I needed to do). The people are nice though, and willing to help.

Thirdly, I’m really struggling with sitting alone in my home in front of a computer for 9.5 hours a day. I’m not even an extrovert, but I’m envisioning my days for the foreseeable passing in the same way, and it kind of terrifies me.

Lastly, I don’t care about the software, or really the company. It’s corporate software. and rails backend, which seemingly would set me up for … more rails backend. With them.

TEFL teaching was at turns rewarding and frustrating, but I felt trapped with no prospects, so coding seemed like a means to an end, in this case money/options. However, teaching felt like a better ‘fit’. I really enjoy educating, and while I found it quite exhausting, I realise now that I enjoy the socialising and interacting. I’m starting to really miss it.

I enjoyed the bootcamp, and designing and building web apps. I like front-end, the designing and creating parts, and enjoyed the backend when I knew wtf I was doing. That’s what actively drew me in. However, am I passionate about coding? Not particularly.

I do think the front-end route would be what I need to take if I want to derive satisfaction and enjoyment, but I’m afraid the same will happen and I’ll learn it was just a pipe dream, and most jobs are like this.

I’m at a loss for what to do. I realise I may be panicking, but everyday I’m filled with this feeling and the need to figure out what to do. It’s impacting my motivation.

I will say, it’s a graduate scheme so in theory, not much should be expected of me. We have classes (not related to tech), and can use our free time to learn a bunch of courses on different platforms. However, in reality, I’m pretty stressed all day trying to figure out wtf I’m doing.

I’m also 31, and while I know people chop and change careers, especially in tech, all the time, I’m aware of time ticking, and feeling the disappointment of a career change that might not be what I hoped for.

* Should I just start looking for a junior front-end role now?
* bite the bullet and dedicate to stay for at least 6 months/ 1 year, while brushing up on front-end so that I can eventually land a job. This is probably the most sensible, but I foresee it being a miserable year due to the reasons I mentioned above, and I’m afraid I’ll struggle.
* Get back into teaching and dedicate myself to it as a career. It might be tough, I might not make anywhere near as much money, but at least I’ll feel more fulfilled.

As you can tell, I’m pretty lost, confused, and stressed.
