 I'm working as  senior helpdesk support (talking with clients, Crud operations in Mysql, writing reports) in a small company for almost 1.5 years. And recently I've  got an opportunity to get the job as the junior DBA and successfully passed all interviews in big company. Even if I know nothing, the company  are ready to give mentor that'll monitor me and make the plan of thinggs to learn for me during the trial period in which I'll be paid slightly more than my current job. If I pass the trial, in perspective it'd be more and more bigger one year later.

In my current company if I learn Java and other things (html, css, angular,js) I  will have an interview with the head of development team and transition to DEV to work as the full-stack developer.  

And now I'm in dilemma what to choose. If I go after first, I'll gain more experience with databases (postgresql, cassandra) and bigger salary in perspective. Work also won't be boring,in fact it'll be very challenging and tough (for several months). But, at least for one year or two I will be busy to learn DBA thing and working with two-three projects or even more. 
As  for another case, if I  choose to stay at my current workplace ,  by learning Java I have the chance to transit to the Dev directly as the other people who were in the support before me or like my junior colleague who will transit to the Dev team in three-four months. 


As I have no experience in both, I want to ask: 
Are there people who have experience of being DBA and later DEV? Is it worth to work and gain experience as the dba and  after 1-2 year transit to the dev? Will it be useful in developing? Or should I just directly jump into the dev and learn database things by self-studying?

&amp;#x200B;

I started working full time this year in March with my main role being a software engineer, the first 6 months was a training period and I've just joined a project last month. The project is clientside work for a Risk management system within a financial/banking company. Two weeks ago was the first time I was actually assigned a Jira task and last week was when I completed it but it was only some small SQL queries to write. My current task is Java, JS and JSP related. Part of me is also worried that, while I have been with my company since march, I effectively haven't had much actual work experience yet. 

My starting salary was £28,500 when I joined and after the training period it went up to £30,500 (\~$42,000). My work has been completely remote (working from home) and I live in London with family but I am looking to move out with friends as soon as I can (within London still but I want to be independent). However, I think it would be quite tight with my current salary and therefore I am looking for a higher salary either through promotion at my current job or moving to another company to leverage my skills (which I've been told often can achieve a higher salary than staying with the current company). In terms of these I don't think I'd actually be actively searching for new jobs until near March when I would have been with my company for a year but I'm just thinking in advance. 

I know it may seem early to be considering promotion or moving jobs already when I've just started a project but I'm trying to look forward and make the most of what I can do because I've had friends working for 4+ years since they left university and they're on a lower salary than me and I don't want to become stagnant. I'm very ambitious and would ideally like to be on £100k+ before I turn 30 - the specific value of it isn't so important but I want to be financially stable and be able to support my family.

My questions:

* Is this realistic? 
* What advice can you give me?
* If you're a software engineer/former software engineer, what has been your career progression so far?
* Should I be focusing on getting into any industries like FinTech or working as a software engineer within finance generally? 

&amp;#x200B;

My background:

* 25 year old Male
* MEng Electronic and Communications Engineering Degree from The University of Leeds, UK (it's an integrated Master's i.e. 3 years bachelor and 1 final year as the Master's year with reduced modules, 4 years total)
* Proficiencies: 
   * Java, C++
   * JavaScript, Typescript
   * Spring Boot
   * MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Angular
   * SQL
   * HTML, CSS
   * Some self taught Python including libraries like pandas, numpy, openpyxl, bs4 etc

I can still code and is capable of learning advanced stuff but I know I will not be great at it so I want to become a web-designer who also knows how to code a little(JavaScript, PHP...) but focuses more on visuals.

Especially in my country I've heard they're earning only 12 000 - 15 000$ which is really low.

 Does it still make sense to become a web-designer nowadays or should I just try to become a web-developer/software engineer, or any position that involves heavy coding knowledge and very high problem solving skills instead, knowing that I'm not gonna be good at it?

I’m currently interested in web dev and actually started learning html/css and I love every bits of it. 

What I hate about sys admin work is the on call/after hours maintenance/down time reponse/weekend work. It’s stressful that servers might go down anytime, can’t do maintenance on work hours since users’ work rely on the servers, etc.

Would I be facing this on dev side? I’m assuming not really since dev does not care about infrastructure? I don’t mind working overtime or even spend some time working on weekend for deadlines, just hate it when it’s for unexpected server going down.

I have always been a top performer and a leader in the company, including the new team. I own arch for large MM costly projects, etc. In the arch role for 5 years.

I have been clear with my new manager every quarterly review that I am pursuing the next step in this role, and solicited feedback and acted on it. I am repeated told that I am “on the list “ , “doing everything right” etc. It has been almost two years under him.

I just learned that he promoted a new team member over me, who has only been in an architecture role for less than one year; it had to do with a high visibility project, and he works hard, so no shade here. He’s a colleague and friend. At the same time I realized that all my new team members were hired in above me as well, and I am not only senior to all of them in experience, technical expertise, and domain knowledge, but in workload as well, but I am now low-man on the team. I get relentlessly positive feedback from my manager and all my peers, and so I am not understanding why this isn’t translating into the promotion. I am wondering if maybe I am just not being considered for the bump at all. I worked like 60 hours last week, butt-in-seat, and more on Slack and just thinking.  My manager HAS to know that if he unhappy with this. I don’t want leave now though, bonus season is in a few months and we did really well this year. I know for sure though that I can’t wait another year for the next promotion season. And I really like my company, generally I’m highly respected (afaik lol) and autonomous.

Anyway, with that context, do you think it’s safe to approach my manager with my unhappiness, before I start interviewing? Or should I wait and come to him with an offer? I have added job info to LinkedIn for the first time since I was hired (I like my company), and holy smoke I have had six phone calls with recruiters this week already. Market is nuts. But again I like my company… I am keeping the job search veeery close, I don’t want it getting back to him. Hope LinkedIn isn’t giving hints to my peer network.

I am worried that he will just start the backfill process when I announce intent, and then I will be forced to leave before bonus season. Or he will view this as betrayal and fuck with me.

For frontend guys it's always Vue or React.

I honestly don't understand why modern programming education is focused so highly on frameworks.  I started programming at 2009 when I was 16 and I learned by using Game Maker --- but after that I made sure I dove deeeep into every craft I wanted to learn. I started my Github account in 2013 --- before that I hosted my projects on SourceForge and I haave a lot of low-level stuff there. Implementation of ML algorithms, framework-free frontend stuff...

But then I met this girl on Instagram who saw an ML model I had deployed and she asked me to help her. Every book she reads is based on JS frameworks. They're not teaching her any vanilla JS. She struggles with the most basic of programming concepts.

TLDR: Should I focus on projects and little amount of LC. Or lots a LC and show off my iPad app as the project example of what I can do. 

I'm switching to SWE after realizing that I like coding more then the manufacturing engineering stuff. I have one solid Swift App I worked on a year ago and no real projects, but, it's on github with documentation. There seems to be infinite things to learn and I just got done with Freecodecamps CSS HTML and Javascript basics course. I want to do front end so I have two paths. 

1. Work on a portfolio page to highlight my resume and my last project showing 2 large projects. And then just LC easy questions practice. 
2. Bank on the one project and my other engineering experience that shows competence and then just do a crap ton of LC questions starting now. 

I'm applying for an entry level government job to get my foot into the industry with a referral from my friend who says that he had an easy coding question (like given X and Y variables and the input of the shape calculate the area. Which is basically taking the input then if statements). Basically I'm not aiming for FAANG but a normal midwest government stuff. 

Which route should I go?  


Also should I even be aiming for that type of position or should I put more time (planning on switching  in a couple months after solo studying for a couple months) and aim for a higher position? (Issue there is that even though I can code the Data Structures and Algorithm questions seem to be a bit daunting and I thought I could use the government job as a means to learn that stuff after work since it would be only 40 hours a week vs the 60 I crank out these days).

I'm mainly JS and we don't use a whole lot of JS. While I've learned 2 new languages while being here and they're great, it's not what I wanted. I wanted JS and some modern stuff really. Like React, node, express etc... This company is great, but it's kinda legacy more or less.

So I was thinking of applying for new jobs, that are using more modern practices and doing more of the work that interests me. 

But I feel bad, because obviously my company needs me, and they gave me my first dev job and opportunity. So I wanted to give them my thanks, by doing a good job and making myself a good investment for the people that gave me this chance.

So am I in the wrong, if I got a new gig? I feel bad and guilty, I feel I should be here at least a year before moving on. So I haven't applied yet.

I work in a small -medium sized msp, the company owns an under development cloud unit and I'm it, as MS gold partner we work exclusively on Azure (I'm AZ-900, AZ-104 certified) but my first love are networking (even more on prem) and security.

I enjoy the cloud world but maybe due to the lack of work on this side (we are based in not so wealthy zone of EU, so poor budget customers and even more poor internet infrastructure are a standard) or maybe because I see IT admin working on switch and firewalls (we use HPE, Aruba, Sophos and Sonic Wall) I'm pretty into the idea to go back to what I like and get into on-prem, talked to my IT Manager (he's cloud project manager too and really deep into this project)  and he said that's ok.

BTW I'm into CCNA course since a year but for a lack of time due to work/MS certs/university I haven't closed the question (I hope for the early 2022).

Ok, let's go to the point: what scares me

\-I will focus a lot less on cloud, and if cloud will rise even more in the future am I loosing a big opportunity? On prem will be still alive in the future?

\-Aruba hardware doesn't seems to have a lot of prestige outside (not like Cisco,Juniper,Palo Alto etc) will that give me less opportunity when I will change company?

What I think are the PROS:

\-I could become a kind of figure that can hybridate well on prem and cloud (I will not leave at 100% Azure, and I'm really interested in networking on it and related certs like AZ-700)

\-Gain experience on switching,firewalls and VMware virtualization, Veeam backup and Windows Server.

\-Get company paid certs.

What do you think?
