I feel like I'm in the wrong program, but I do have a scholarship, so I plan on graduating as soon as possible with my undergrad. I have a decent GPA of 3.65.

Now I have a couple of choices; one is to return to China and seek international economics/ finance-related jobs, but I want to pursue further education. One of my friends with an average undergrad degree but attended Columbia's Fintech program landed an excellent job at Citibank. My interests and knowledge lie closer to data science and machine learning, and I'm contemplating doing the data science BootCamp there. I also thought perhaps I should do a master's program in computer science. I also saw an online program at UC Berkeley specific in data science, which means I can attend from China while working a job.

It is possible for me to do a masters in CS after my undergrad degree in econ.

1) Do employers care about your degree? Is it worth me changing to mathematics?
2) Is a mathematics/econ degree sufficient to be considered by employers (I ask this because the technical interviews are not a concern for me)?
3) Should I do a masters in CS to make up for my non-relevant academic background?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi r/cscareerquestions. First time, long time!  

  

Background:  

\-I am 25 years old.  

\-No kids, no wife, no nothing.  

\-No tech background whatsoever. My past career highlights include managing a Subway restaurant for 12$ an hour, and digging ditches for 450$ a week.  

\-My parents are dead and I’ve been pity mooching off some extended family for the last few years.  

\-At year’s end I will have an A.S. in Computer Programming and Analysis. \*(the difference between an A.S. and an A.A. at least in my college is that an A.S. cuts out half the general education requirements and focuses more on technical classes)\*  

  .  

  .  

I’m certainly not a beginner in regards to programming, but I’m nowhere near a professional level at the moment. C# and Java, object orientated languages are my favorite because I feel like I understand them the most.  Classes, objects, constructors, public/private methods, poly, how things interact, etc. That's all down pact. I can also read documentation to get what I want out of public libraries most of the time.  

  

But man… I look at something like Leetcode and determine that I’ve landed on Mars. Data Management might as well be rocket science. GitHub might as well be Facebook for Klingon’s.  

  

I like to think that my problem solving skills are good enough, that I’m fairly clever, that I can be \*\*\*the master of the universe\*\*\*. Though isn’t that what anybody and everybody thinks? Each person on the planet assumes they’re above average and half of them are assuredly provably wrong.  

  

My portfolio is mainly .txt or the odd .exe files of stuff I’ve written, hosted on my basic ass web-page. \*(that I also wrote)\* I really should learn how to put things on GitHub.. Most of the programs I’ve written are this small petty beginner level, cookie cutter \*\*nonsense\*\*. For example the other day I made a C# windows form that keeps track of rocket league game stats. It saves a file with a custom .rtlg extension, and allows you to load that same .rtlg file to continue after you've closed the program. Vast majority of the things I’ve done are console applications, which are lame. I’ve used Java Swing as well. The knock with Windows forms and Java Swing is that everything looks like its from 1999. I’ve also built a simple webpage that accepts input from a text box and then stores the string into a MySQL server table. It is the only work I’ve ever done with any back-end data storage.  

  

What should my next move be? Learn how to put stuff on GitHub? I have a feeling that absolutely no employer is going to give two shits about some .txt files on my personal web-page. Even if by some miracle a person does find them, stating “nothing I have crafted is impressive” would be an understatement.  

  

When I look at Revature, I see a place that with an ability to swallow someone whole. But if I make it through, they guarantee a 45k a year honest to goodness job! Double anything I’ve ever earned! I know that 45k is under market value, and that we’re living in this scarce hyper-inflated hellscape, but it seems like my only shot.  

  

I’ve worn out my welcome at my current living situation and there’s an expectation that I’m finding a job once this semester is over and getting the fuck out. Getting a bachelors degree doesn’t seem viable at this time.

  

I’m still going to apply at other non Revature places. Willing to work literally anywhere in the USA \*(except New Jersey…. ok maybe New Jersey)\*, but I don’t think my prospects are great. If Revature is willing to have me \*(their website states you only need an associates degree)\* it seems like a great option. A paid bootcamp with a job waiting at the end.  

  

Also I’m not really a people person. I do ok when forced into social situations, but I don’t seek them out, and I’m dreadful at maintaining relationships.

I have a written offer from a smaller WebHostCompany and a verbal offer from mid-sized TechCompany for the same yearly salary (I'm obvi not good at negotiating ha). Both fully remote, with comparable benefits.  


* Mid-sized TechCompany sounds kinda toxic, *horrible* Glassdoor reviews. When I asked about the bad Glassdoor reviews, they said that the reviews are true, but they hired new execs and are actively working on fixing toxic aspects... One manager confessed during an interview that he was only planning on staying long enough to get experience migrating data from an on-prem server to the cloud. Exciting project tho - complete data overhaul utilizing new technologies (AWS, Spark, Databricks). Possibly better growth opportunities, that is if I can handle the lingering toxicity lol. I like a bit of a hustle, but idk man. Burnout happens quicker than you'd think... Oh, and only 15 days accumulative PTO.  

* Smaller WebHostCompany seems like the chiller/more sane option. Unlimited PTO, stock options, matching 401k. Great Glassdoor reviews. Project seems less exciting - but still using cloud tech. Everyone I spoke with on the team had nothing but positive things to say; they would all foreseeably be working there in 5+ years.

I've read this ""[golden standard](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)"" of salary negotiation, and countless others, but i honestly can't process any of this right now.

Some facts about my current situation:

1. gave a salary range when i applied, to which the HR director sounded like it was acceptable (compared to other companies that sounded sour)
2. The company is already behind schedule hiring this role, needed to push a product by end of year
3. every step of the interview process they really liked me. everyone involved. CTO also approves of me
4. i don't have any other offers or even ongoing interviews. they dont know that but just wanted to point out to you guys.
5. i really need this job
6. they still want references from my current managers. I already told them that i dont want to ask for references until i know im the final candidate just in case. HR was very understanding of that. I know my managers will give at LEAST a decent reference because ive done nothing wrong at all during my year at this organization.
7. no equity, just salary, fair benefits (nothing extraordinary)
8. again, really *need* this job.

I feel like they are going to offer me the lowest end of the range, which is ""acceptable"" to me as in i would still take it if need be, middle range is totally acceptable, but honestly highest range is more required not because i wanna be greedy, but simply because of the amount of work that would be expected of me, which i didnt fully know until i started the actual interview process with them.

how can i best go about negotiating the salary without offending them or them rescinding their offer? what do i say? when do i know to stop pushing their buttons?

I worked 10 hour days and studied programming at home, but I didn't perform well. I was slow to roll out code, I had questions about literally everything, and I just couldn't seem to keep up with the workload dumped on me. The buzzwords ""fast-paced environment"" scare me at this point, lol.

That said, we never pair-programmed, and my team lead was only available for 3 hours a day, so I couldn't ask questions after he left. I was thrown into the financials system, which my supervisor later told me that he regretted throwing me in there because it was overly complex for a person of my skillset. I left the job after 6 months in, when they had discussed shifting me over to QA work.

I had a 3.95 when I graduated with my associates, and due to personal constraints, I couldn't go all the way for a bachelors degree. Which I regret on about a weekly basis. But I did really well in school, and probably a lot more effortlessly than most people. I aced my Java course.

Ever since then, I landed a job as a Systems Administrator and have been progressing nicely for the past half decade. In fact, I'd argue that I'm really good at what I do... but I still can't help the fact that I feel awful about having failed as a programmer. I've participated in programming code camps and read some programming books, but I feel like I never really learn anything from them. I'm beyond the point of writing a ""hello world"" script but anything beyond that is difficult for me to grasp. I feel as if I need the practice of deploying and building code in a realistic environment. Like I desperately need to pair program to effectively learn; I can't seem to find the next 'step' after graduating and learning the most basic of basics.

I'm also worried about my future. I make a pretty mediocre salary, and at my current place of employment, I don't use a lot of technology that a lot of companies are looking for. I want to work from home remotely, 100% of the time, which is difficult as someone who deals with a lot of physical servers and is a glorified help desk support. And furthermore, I have no desire to go home and code, which I recognize sets me far behind a lot of developers who love doing this stuff in their free time. I think I'd be more likely to code if I could actually accomplish something doing it, but I'm frankly just... very bad at it.

I've just started a job at a large NY based AdTech Software company, my job is in Client Success. 

My partner is a Brazilian - American, and she recently took a job which requires that she split her time between Sao Paolo Brazil and New York. While at my previous company, I took advantage of remote work to travel with her and work from her home in Sao Paolo. I was working for a smaller company (no VPNs, formal policies on working outside of the country), and my manager approved of my working from abroad for several weeks at a time so long as I maintained certain hours. 

I'm curious how to broach this with my new company. It's a much more corporate environment than my previous employer, and though I haven't seen any specific policy around working from outside of the country, I'm wary of the optics of broaching the subject with my manager while being a new employee. With that being said, I believe that 'Work From Anywhere' is the future of Tech, and with the company entirely remote, I don't see any issue with working from outside of the country for a couple of weeks at a time. I'd like to spend a couple of weeks working from Brazil over the next few months, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot and raise any flags with my new employer.

Anyway, I graduate in 2 months and like everyone else graduating soon, I am now looking for a job and have been applying to many places. I think I have around 200-300 applications now over the past 3 months. I have had multiple interviews now as I mentioned before.

I feel very depressed now and I do not know what I can do to improve my chances of getting a job offer.

They love that I have a project that I implemented OAuth2 authentication on the server, end to end encryption by myself and that I know all of the Linux commands and latest technologies in use there like Docker.

But, at the end of the day, every interview I do, they always come back to me and say that they went with someone that had more experience than me even though that candidate do not have as much knowledge as I do (I know this information due to recruiters). Literally last week I had an interview with Cisco where I nailed everything perfect and they were joking around with me and explaining everything that they do at the job, you know like when they want to offer you the job. Nope, three days later they hired someone else that knew less than me because they had graduated already. 

I didn't get lucky like everyone else where they had internships, all of my internships got cancelled last year because of COVID when I was a junior. I'm working at this teaching job, teaching Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and C# for the past 2 years in January. I also am like a pseudo-manager and I manage the internal system we use that run Linux and deploys various things using docker, and I help maintain a few of website using Spring.

Now it is like at the back of my mind as I apply to 10-15 jobs each day now is that I am not good enough and I probably don't deserve anything.

I'm pretty late because of life trouble that led to me starting late and having to work (not cs-related jobs) while studying. 

I have been contacted by the HR of an important company for an internship and I assumed that they had looked at my profile before contacting me, which, along with a few questions on my known programming languages during the phone interview, led me to believe that I'd be in a software developer role, which is my desired career path and THE stuff I worked towards during these long years, towards which I also developed a passion I dare say. I may lack practical experience and not know what are the state-of-the-art best practices, but I feel competent and can I feel like I can learn anything with the notions I learned during my studies.

With that said, the company is trying to insert me into this department that is mostly dealing with server setup (upgrade from physical machines to virtual to save costs, machines that need to manage networks and connections from the little I gathered) and whenever I mention programming I get comments such as ""yeah that's a useful skill to have"", which implies that that's not at all what I will be learning (or doing).

My dilemma is the following: the company is pretty important, is serious and has some very good values, I really like the idea of working here. On the other hand I have no preparation and frankly no interest in what they are training me to do, to the point I get almost sick thinking that the bulk of my studying won't be of use. 

I know this might sound whiny and I realize that work isn't always about what you *want* to do, and I don't even know if this is the sub for this kind of questions, but this situation is really tough on me mentally right now and I could use some advice and guidance from a third party with more experience.

In the end I received a better offer from a separate company but turned them down based on their pension contribution being too low despite them repeatedly offering me a higher base salary (tax reasons).

It infuriates me that recruiters seem to think that just because we are developers we must do nothing but write code all day every day, or that we are 'lesser' developers for not doing so.

I believe he's fairly new to the company, maybe here a year.  I've been doing this for around four years now.  When I was starting out, I had a coworker that mentored me and helped me a lot.  Now that I'm competent in developing, I want to be able to teach/mentor.  However, it's hard to find the balance between helping, or guiding in the right direction, and doing the work.  Furthermore, often times I'll have to play around with the code before being able to give advice because it won't really click until I do.

Long story short, this script my coworker was working on (and I was also assigned to contribute), I basically reworked it to the state it's currently in.  What he was doing was really bad. What he presented to business leaders would not be presentable if I did not step in and fix things. When I got  help in the past, I always gave shoutouts.  Additionally, if I worked on something with someone, I was always careful how I phrased things, like saying ""we worked on"" etc.  When he presents, he keeps phrasing as ""my scripts"", which makes it seem my contributions were minimal.  I will say that maybe my failure was taking over rather than guiding in the right direction? The reason I reworked things is because I tried explaining to him but he kept doing things incorrectly, so I figured I'd rework it to a point where he could add things.  

My first thought was, I'm never helping this kid again. And also, I figure there's git history, so maybe people will know. Idk what to do.
