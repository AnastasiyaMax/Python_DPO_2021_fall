Not sure whether I should disclose the names in a post but to walk on the side of caution I'll just say they are both pretty big, global companies (not google and ibm level though), both quite keen to take interns back after graduation and with seemingly healthy approach to work culture.

\-being the go-to person who will advise the business on how to develop new analytical insights

Yesterday, my boss got mad at me (made the mistake of asking him if there's anything I should be focusing on while waiting for our time to connect, which he said would be in a couple hours, due to his meetings. Some of you might remember that post  and I do understand what I did was wrong and not to say anything again until when we actually connect).

So from end of June to end of September, I was using the same timesheet code (we're gov contractors so the codes are important). I didn't have that much work till I got on a second timesheet code a couple weeks ago, so I pretty much just stayed on the first timesheet code for everything during those 3 months. There were some days I had actual work and there were some days that I didn't (in which I would just do NIST readings and learn other things these days to fill up the time during work and then I would add these down on to the timesheet as well, under that same timesheet code). So basically, yesterday my boss wanted me to write down weekly entries for each week during the 3 months that I was on the first timesheet core. He wants me to write down each task I did each week on that code and for how long I did it for. This took me like 3-4 hours to do cuz I had to look at my previous timesheets and figure out how long I must have took for each task for in the 40 hours of that week (I only write down brief descriptions of what I did each day in my timesheet so I don't really have the exact time limits). After I finished, I finally submitted it to his email. 

I feel like he's going to use this task to see if it's worth keeping me on the team or not. I feel like he gave me this because he got mad at me (which really isn't that often but he has gotten annoyed at me before on other unrelated things).

* \- Korean 
* \- Graduated from American university with a bachelor in psych
* \- Attended 6-month coding boot camp that mainly focused on Java along with the general full-stack stuff
* \- Currently doing a 3-month internship at a small company (# of employee &lt; 30) that specializes in natural language processing and chatbot with Rasa framework. This company also has a team that also does some regular web dev work by using Vue.js and Spring.

 I've talked to my friend who's working as a senior front-end developer in NY and he said that focusing on JS along with other currently-popular back-end language will land me a job in America more easily than focusing on AI &amp; Machine Learning. 

Before attending the boot camp, I had no prior knowledge of software engineering and along with the start of this internship, this is also my first time learning Python, algorithms, NLP and etc. So I'm still newbie af regarding the both career paths.

My internship ends in November 30th and this company is about to start working on this big project that will result in nation-wide distribution of the final product. My boss has expressed a couple of times that he would like me to keep working with them but I don't know whether I'll also participate in web dev work once I'm finished with Rasa deployment that I'm working on right now. 

My goal is to eventually get a developer position in USA. 

Right now, I can only think of 3 possible options that I can do:

1. Stay in this company, accept the full-time position and keep digging into NLP &amp; Machine Learning
2. Stay in the company but express my desire to participate in web-dev work
3. Leave and look for a new full-stack developer position.

When I was 12 I learned programming ,and it has been 8 years now. In my tight knit highschool community I always thought of myself as the “computer geek”, and so it became my personality. This led to an increasing anxiety, I always felt I had to be a perfectionist aka the best at computers. This ironically led me to procrastinate learning the deeper aspects of computer science and only stay at a surface level, while elevating my ego higher and higher. I firmly remember when I lost my first programming competition, instead of still moving forwards I cried like a bitch, it felt as if I wasn’t special anymore. Fast forward 4 years im in university pursuing software engineering, and almost everyone around me is a god as programming. I still get analysis paralysis ,or coding anxiety trying to write basic graphical problems, while I sit in class with people who have : developed their own programming languages, won international programming competitions, etc. This has caused me to regress further and further into depression, I went from a big fish in a small pond to a plankton in the ocean… What’s worse internship seeking season is around the corner and looking at my resume of basically nothing makes me feel like shit. My hopes of getting an internship is further demolished after seeing some of my genius peers getting declined. Hardwork beats Genius if genius doesn’t work hard ,but I can neither work due to my anxiety nor am I a genius. My parents ,and friends don’t really grasp the conundrum I am in since my GPA is still okay and I am doing better than some people. But I can’t cope with this imposter syndrome… And for the icing on top of the cake my communication skills suck ass aswell since I always thought of myself as the gifted child all throughout childhood. I write this for two things, advice and letting this off my chest. Deep down I know that I truly would like to do in the Computer Science – Tech world ,but am too tensed to do anything about it. Whenever I see someone else smarter than me or one of my old highschool friends excelling as a programmer I get depressed and anxious. What would you do in my situation? A couple of years ago I thought I was the next Bill Gates ,though now I would just be happy being able to code without feeling like crap. I have been constantly brooding and looking at resume of successful people without doing anywork or having decision paralysis on what to learn (web dev, ML , Data structures) and then giving up and binging Youtube. For the last 5 months I have gotten things under control and lost a lot of weight and fixed most aspects of my life instead of the coding paralysis / ergophobia part.

I'm not sure if I should drop out of the Cs degree and just learn python 3 fully for the years n months, instead of going on with the Cs degree ...what would you advise.

Focus on python and become a full time Python programmer or keep grinding for the Cs degree and keep spending more money?

A little background: I started as a intern in 2019 at a f500 company in north NJ. I did work on real projects but nothing too crazy. Mostly use java(which im very comfortable with) to help them add new features to their backend applications and helped them migrate their legacy apps to use newer technologies and so on.

I was able to learn a lot about maven and git here but i only have very surface level knowledge of spring/sprintboot/jenkins and I’m only able to work on these applications because I just google how to do a certain task using spring and then apply that in our apps(basically without google i dont know anything)

I feel like my wage is low because every I know who graduated with me have already crossed 90k using their cs degrees. I need a new job but all the job listing i see require knowledge of aws, JavaScript/react, spring, micro services. I’m thinking about taking a course online that can help me learn more about aws,java microservive, jenkins, react. Do you have any advice on what I should do? Also if you do recommend me taking courses does anyone know some good courses i can take that can help me learn.

I applied to a few places for grad programmes, got an offer from a big 4 accounting firm for what is essentially the very least they could pay me. The programme is in their risk advisory department and seems vaguely interesting, but I'm not sure how much it will actually use my degree.

Still waiting on an offer from a national bank, they have 50+ business units and no central IT dept, in the interviews I expressed interest in their data science unit. They can only get back to me in January but have been steadily communicative. Made it through psychometric + aptitude tests and two rounds of interviews. They *may* pay more, but salary information is truly hard to come by.

Finally, a friend of mine that hasn't yet graduated is interning at a small company, making hourly what the accounting place is offering me. My GPA is definitely better than theirs, and they said themselves that another person is making nearly twice what they are because they just negotiated better.

I've accepted the offer from the accounting place, but the contract does provide for 1 week's notice to leave within the first 6 months.

Should I try to use the connection to the smaller company to start off with a bigger salary? Negotiation is not my strong suit but I do feel that the pressure is off considering I already have a firm ""safe"" offer.

The new conference format ""Humboldt meets Leibniz"" aims  to change that and shed light on the career-building mechanisms in  academia.

Its concept is simple  but unique: 14 Award winners of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation  will share their expertise in optics and photonics and their  career-building experiences with the next generation of scientists.

Thus,  150 PhD students and Postdocs will be selected to attend this premier  conference in Hannover, Germany. Their research shall focus on optical  technologies, including material simulation, quantum optics, simulation,  laser systems, optical imaging, metrology, and manufacturing  technology.

The event comprises  classic poster sessions, presentations and discussions on research and  career-building topics, and time for networking. Registration ends 1  November 2021 at [www.uni-hannover.de/HmL](https://www.uni-hannover.de/HmL). The selected participants will receive up to 1,000 euros in travel allowances.

The  following scientists will support Humboldt meets Leibniz – Emerging  Topics in Optics and Photonics and travel to Hannover 2022:

""Humboldt  meets Leibniz – Emerging Topics in Optics and Photonics"" is organised  by Leibniz University Hannover (Germany) in cooperation with the  VolkswagenStiftung (Germany) and with the support of the Alexander von  Humboldt Foundation (Germany). The conference takes place in Hannover  from 12 till 14 June 2022.

The  Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD: Photonics, Optics, and Engineering –  Innovation Across Disciplines at Leibniz University Hannover is the  co-operational partner of this conference. For this reason, the content  of the kick-off conference will focus on optics and photonics.

Optical  technologies and laser technology have a long tradition at the Hannover  location. With over 110 million euros in state funding from 2019 to  2025 for the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD and the OPTICUM - Optics  University Center and Campus, research on optical technologies in  Hannover is steadily gaining importance.

Leibniz  University Hannover plans to build the OPTICUM, a research building  with 4,000 square metres of floor space in the Hannover-Marienwerder  Science Park. After its planned completion in 2026, around 120  researchers from the Leibniz Research School of Optics and Photonics of  the Leibniz University Hannover will move into the four-storey OPTICUM  to work together on the digitalisation of precision optics and optics  production.

In addition, with  quantum research in the second Cluster of Excellence at Leibniz  University Hannover - QuantumFrontiers -, and the Quantum Valley Lower  Saxony (QVLS), there is another high technology in Lower Saxony being  publicly funded with around 75 million euros.

So I was wondering if anyone faced something similar with startups and how did it go? Are they planning to overwork me to the bone if I accept such an offer? 
Any advice or stories are welcomed!

I now work within electric systems, DBCMS or something of that matter (Still very much learning, haha)  
However, it is something that I hated, and actively tried to avoid. 

I'd love to work on the API team, or maybe even the Fleet management software, stuff like that.

Startups have lots of room for growth, so what would you do?

How long should I bite the bullet till I request to be moved over to something I find more suitable?

 And where do I position myself today to get into that field?
