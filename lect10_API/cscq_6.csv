I am currently 19 years old and I tought myself how to code websites. I took lots of online courses about web development and I would like to think I am pretty goot at javascript and front end frameworks. I also often work with php.   
About a year ago I started my first dev job as a front-end developer at a compony of 50 people working there. At first I was really hyped about the fact that I just started my career as a professional developer, but after a while that started to fade. My main tasks where building custom Wordpress themes which I have gotten pretty good at but after about half a year I started finding it boring. I started to get annoyed about my fellow collegues who would only argue about small petty stuff like css/scss class names and css best practices, and felt like the work I was doing started to become  meaningless.   
Even though I have gotten pretty good at building websites I still feel like I am not a good developer at all. I suck at algorithms and I could not even write one line of c++ (Or any big non-frontent language). I want to dive deeper into computer science and become a great developer but I kinda feel stuck right now.  I am good enough to get a junior front-end job but I don't believe I am a good programmer at all.  
On the one hand I would like to maybe go to college but what keeps me from doing that is  the fear of waisting 4 years of my life (And a lot of money). I have heard lots of stories from developers who studied in IT and now claim to not use anything they learned in their programming job at all.  
And on the other hand I think it might be a good idea to go the solo route by doing a lot of self-study. But here I face the downside of discipline and learning structure. There is so many information out there that I don't know where to start to become a great developer and also my adhd doesn't help with this.

Hi guys! I am a 22 year old female that lives in Florida. I am currently enrolled at Western Governor's University for their Computer Science degree. 

After leaving my previous shitty job, I was unemployed for around 6-8 weeks, before I started a new job with an insurance company. 
I am remote (until February), I get paid $18.00 an hour, I have a 401k for the first time, and the insurance is pretty decent. 

Today, one of the places I applied to previously reached out to me. It's not a job technically, it is a program run by the county I live in. This program is 5 days a week for 12 weeks. In it we intern with one of the IT companies that the program partners 3x a week (where it ""maybe"" 8 hours a day, but at a guaranteed $15 an hour) and then we attend class 2x a week, to be taught the Network+ and a COMPTIA certifications. 

I obviously wouldn't be able to keep my new full-time job and do the internship at the same time, and I'm having a hard time choosing which path I should take.

The internship sounds great but I applied to dozens of ""entry-level"" CS positions when i was unemployed, but i never received a single call back. I would barely be making enough money to cover my share of the bills, and the fact that i could technically get the certifications through my college for free, whenever i am ready to actually take the test. At the end of the 12 weeks, the interns have a chance to be scouted to work full-time at any of the workplaces, but no guarantees. I wouldn't want to have to leave the program and then be unable to find a job after. 
A plus is that i hate learning online, and i think I'd really enjoy being back in the classroom again. Especially when I'm still learning the basic fundamentals

On the other hand, I hate my current job, BUT it is with a large national corporation and they have an inhouse IT team in every building. If i hold out for 6 months, i can (maybe) transfer to the IT department and try to work my way up from there. My company has a very ""promote from within"" culture. I also have never made this much money before and i love being able to actually save money, instead of struggling paycheck to paycheck anymore. Also the work office when I go back is a 5 minute commute from where i live. I have also been eating healthier and enjoying spending time with my pets. I would have to spend more money on car maintenance and add time commuting.

My best friend says take the internship and get my foot in the door   My boyfriend says tough it out with the job i have. I can see both sides of the argument. Can you guys help me choose? If it helps, I live in the Tampa Bay area which is growing pretty rapidly in the tech scene.

One semester with all withdrawal marks, and my last semester with straight F's because it was too late to withdraw. I had depression and anxiety and felt like a failure. Luckily I had worked and applied to a ton of non academic scholarships while doing school, so I wasn't in any debt. 

I taught myself web development (I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JS) over a few months while I was living at home. My school had only taught me C, C++, and Java. I applied to each and every intern position that had anything to do with software. After about 30 applications I finally landed one that paid 18/hr and I and then after 3 months it became a full time salary of $40,000.  It was a simple job that didn't use any frameworks. Literally just html, css, and javascript.

After 10 months, I felt like my depression and anxiety had gotten better so I slowly worked off my meds (risky, I know), but I felt like my schooling was what was hurting my mental health, so now that it had almost been a year, I was feeling better. But even knowing my trigger, I decided to quit my job and go back to school. In retrospect this was a waaay sketchy decision, I don't know what lead me to making that decision, but I guess I just really wanted to finish what I started.

I enrolled in Western Governors University. It's an online only University where you go at your own pace. No need to talk to professors, no need to talk to students, no need to go to teacher assistants. BUT, if you need those things, you have access to them. I'm a 99% online solo learner. Youtube/Google baby. It's all there for you to learn...at your own pace. This school was perfect for me. I ended up finishing 5 semesters worth of classes in 8 months (8 hours a day, 6-7 days a week). Computer Science degree done.

Now that I had a degree and a whole 10 months of experience I could get a nice job easy.... Yeah right. 180 applications and a few months later I got a new job as full stack software engineer. Doing react and node stuff for $60k. During those 2-3 months of applying, I built a really cool scheduling application with a drag and drop calendar component. My job said that was the reason the hired me. So don't disregard your own personal projects when you don't have work experience. Build cool, unique things. 

Well now it's been about a year at my current position. I've been applying here and there for $100k+ positions. I'm reaching a bit high for my experience level, but maybe someone will give me a shot. 

LinkedIn. That was the answer. I messaged many people (2nd or 3rd connections) at my dream jobs. They were regular software engineers who also happen to have a heart and know what I was going through, because they probably went through it too. The grind. They told me to give them my resume and they'll see what they can do. Finally, I got an interview.

And I'm not gonna lie, the multiple interviews were rough. I don't think I did the best at some of the coding challenges they gave me. I solved them, but not with the finesse a 24/7 leetcoder would. I really give credit to my soft skills for helping me go up a few points. Nonetheless, I ended up getting an offer for 145k. 

This is just my story. I know some people get bigger offers than this right out of college, some right out of bootcamps, some work up to it over 10+ years, and some transition later in life. I did feel hopeless at one point, but I did it. And I somehow got married and had a kid during all this too haha. Literally don't know how I did it.

I should preface this by saying that I am an academic oddball. I am double-majoring in history and government but minoring in computer science. Most of my experience has been in the field of digital humanities; I apply CS solutions to liberal arts questions. It is very gratifying work.

For a while I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I am considering taking a year off after undergrad to figure out where I want to take my life. I could probably get a policy-related job, but I have been thinking about shooting for a job in tech instead. So far, I have two tech internships I am prepared to show recruiters. 

The first internship involves data science. My university's government department employs me as a programmer. Most of my time is spent writing web scrapers and data cleanup scripts, but I am about to start helping a grad student design a machine learning algorithm. It is a more conventional CS internship which I hope recruiters will find respectable. 

Next semester, I will be interning at a game development startup. It is actually run by a history professor at my university, and it aims to produce educational history games for high schools and universities. I have already met my coworkers: there will be a small team handling story-writing/historical accuracy/etc, another handling the art, and then I will be among the programmers. We will be making it through Unity and C#.

Part of me worries this might be seen as ""juvenile"" work. Another part of me isn't too concerned, as I am building up my Github and it will only be one among multiple projects I can show off. Also, this internship offers a cool opportunity to learn C#.

recently I found roadmap is that made for back-end development and it looks complicated , it shows that knowledge of OS , networking is mandatory before even beginning learning server-side language or DB so

1. if learning these things is really required before diving into server-side programming , any sources can anyone recommend here ?  ,  I found courses but it's academical courses so I guess it would be too much for the required knowledge
2. I know  it may sounds silly to ask  , but it would be really appreciated if you guys share your experience of how you managed to get into the industry , how was your roadmap / track /courses to you took . ?

note :  I graduated from computer engineering , however I was barely passing most of courses so I didn't gained much from having this degreeany help would be deeply appreciated cuz I'm in desperate state in my life and hopefully i can take any step forward

Now I'm a first year in computer science and its not what I thought it would be. Usually people love the programming part but hate the math. I found that I hate both. I'm doing really good in math and  I'm barely passing my intro to programming course and I hate it. I cant figure out how to solve any coding assignment without scrolling through the entire internet trying to find the answer. I watch a lot of YouTube tutorials and rewatch recorded lectures and i just feel like when I see a coding question I get anxious and its just impossible for me to solve it on my own. I feel like I'm just not smart enough and cant think as critically as others. I absolutely dread programming and cant believe that I thought that I liked it when in reality I dread it. I'm only a first year too and i already feel no passion, no excitement and no motivation towards programming. Because of this i spent the last couple weeks researching what I really want to do with my life since cs is definitely not it. And the truth is I really don't like anything. I cant passion in anything or could see myself happy in any career. However I honestly would like to become a pilot. Its the other thing that I have passion for is flying and its something I could see myself happy in. Its also something I wanted to do before I decided to go into cs. However, because of the instability of the job because of covid I chose not to. As well as the fact that i would have to move very far away from home to a very small town to go to flight school which is also way more expensive than normal university. So I felt like its kind of impossible to become a pilot now. So other than that, I have no clue what I should do also since my parents look down on flying planes as a career so I have no idea how to tell them that thats something im interested it.

First a bit of background:

I’ve been doing web development professionally for about 7 months now (4 months at current job) for an agency. I went to school for web dev so I’m not coming into this completely self-taught. Now I’ve read the (horror) stories here regarding junior devs and agencies and can say the agency I work for is great. There seems to be a good level of organization, a robust code review process, and expectations of a junior dev are what I would consider quite reasonable. I’ve even been assigned a mentor.

Lately, I’ve been struggling quite a bit with my work. I’m becoming increasingly concerned with my abilities and knowledge regarding general programming concepts. We work a lot with Drupal (some WordPress and other platforms too) and I’m noticing a pattern lately in the tickets I’ve been assigned. Anything beyond very basic tasks (like setting up a content type or view, for example) I can’t do. Anything needing custom code to be added (custom modules, etc.) I can’t seem to do. Despite a lot of times being told what to do to complete the task I don’t know how to do it. I can’t seem to wrap my head around the programming logic, what classes to use and functions/methods/hooks to use, I completely panic when I read the ticket and see the what is required. Despite being given a month of training with Drupal, I still struggle with it and with things like where files are to be placed, how the platform separate their concerns and the logical processes they use to accomplish things (struggling with modules, for example). This goes for the other  platforms we use as well. I even struggle basic programming concepts like oop and which (php) functions to use and why. I’m constantly asking my mentor for assistance, or passing the ticket to a more experienced developer to complete. I’m constantly going over the allotted time for tickets too. I know my skills are very lacking. I don’t  think it’s impostor syndrome or burn out as is so commonly mentioned here as I feel as even my foundational (programming) skills are lacking.

Has anyone else as a junior experienced this, especially in a work environment that is stable and organized?

After 7 months I feel like my skills should be have progressed significantly further than what they are now. How do I improve quickly and efficiently?

• Database
• Flutter app development. I can convert almost any UI into app confidently. But haven't learned backend yet.
• Comfortable with OOP concepts.
• Solved 300-350 codeforces (A,B mostly)
• pretty confortable at using terminal and linux.


Can you give me some advice on how to prepare myself for tech internships and FANG companies from this level?

I tend to see any variation of ""Is this offer good?"" or, ""Why do I have to grind leetcode?!"". Most of the on-the-job posts consist of ""I am in a toxic environment"" or ""Should I change jobs?""

I have a piece of career advice for anyone who is fairly new to the field that I think could prove helpful. 

First, a little about me as while I'm not going to hinder my anonymity I do feel I'm in a position where I can rightly prescribe advice to newer SE's / grads / those still school: I'm a Principal Engineer, and have a wide array of experience across operations (including release / implementation) as well as experience developing user-facing code, and internal tooling used organization-wide. I've worked in the DOD, networking space, e-commerce, and fin-tech. 

Jobs I've held include:

* Software engineer (senior/staff/principal)
* DevOps Engineer
* Lead DevOps engineer
* Lead Site Reliability Engineer
* Tech Lead
* Software Development Manager
* Director of Operations

One of the greatest skill deficiencies I see in engineers has always been communication. Communication is a very important part of our job. It allows us to promote our ideas, defend our solutions, play the Devil's Advocate, request help, refuse help, patronize others as well as compliment them. We can use communication to self-promote or self-deprecate. Communication literally sets us apart from every other species on this planet; that's not to say other species can't communicate, but that you won't see one chimpanzee explaining to another what the functional use of a blow-hole in Blue Whales is after explaining the nuances in their childrens' respective behavior while foraging for food. 

Here is a hard reality for many engineers: ***Even if you are the best software developer at your entire company, getting others (employees, external customers, internal customers) to actually use what you wrote is a different beast than writing a tool.***

Here is another hard reality: ***Many tasks rely on others to ""un-block us"". There are of course times when the blocker is stubborn enough that solid communication doesn't help, but solid communication never hurts.*** 

It's not uncommon for a developer to feel like a priority queue that relies on other priority queues which are poorly optimized, and plagued with race-conditions. 

Below are some points I'd like to make on the subject of communication:

**Being direct is not mutually exclusive with being polite**. I often find overtly rude people fall on the ""I'm just direct and straightforward!"" excuse as though it actually is an excuse for their rudeness. Consider different ways to say the same thing. This SR, and many others, while not inherently controversial (rudeness is often derived from controversial topics), is plagued with what I'd call ""direct rudeness"". Most of us who have posted here at one point or another have been faced with someone who disagreed but failed to do so in a way that made us feel any productive discussion was possible. 

Consider the following two versions of the same sentence (email threads I've actually witnessed, redacted of course):

&gt;Hello \_\_\_\_\_, you are writing a tool that duplicates work done in a tool I've already written. You need to do a better job of communicating what you're working on so we aren't constantly creating duplicate work and wasting time.

However, consider had it been structured slightly differently:

&gt;Hello \_\_\_\_\_, I noticed you're contributing to a tool which I found here(assume a link to source). I'd like to learn more about your specific needs and perhaps discuss whether $TOOL\_I\_ALREADY\_WROTE would fit them, and if not perhaps we could discuss continuing your thread of work towards enhancing the existing tool-set by adding any features you find it's lacking, as there is certainly some overlap. It'd be great if we could avoid duplicate efforts and enhance a tool that's already in use by the organization. Let me know your thoughts.

Both sentences communicate the same message, but the former puts the recipient on the defensive and immediately raises a few barriers in their mind. Upon receiving it they will be texting / chatting most of their close-colleagues about what a jerk you were. You turned your potential meeting on the topic into a street brawl instead of a discussion. Sometimes it can work out, but why cause additional stress? 

I'd argue that the second version of the sentence still gets the point across but puts the recipient and relative ease and opens a dialogue. To expand upon it a bit more in the second version we acknowledge that the recipient is writing a tool, and raise the concern on the overlapping functionality of that tool with an existing one. The purpose of the email is clearly stated as a goal; avoiding overlap. It's not an accusation but a goal and the use of 'we' puts a collective goal in the recipient's mind. Closing with ""Let me know your thoughts."" opens a dialogue whereas the over-directness of the first version never actually indicates any interest in a dialogue or common goal.

**Everyone is busy, even when they aren't.** We all need things from colleagues, and some colleagues are naturally more busy than others, and some seem like they're never actually working on anything. It's not our job as developers / individual contributors to judge another's workload (and if it is you should evaluate your company's situation). Many things are cyclical and you may be faced with situations where you need a thing done by someone you do not particularly enjoy working with. I have found strategies in communicating with such people that have been effective, for the most part. 

People love when you acknowledge ""how busy they are"" even when they aren't ever really busy from your perspective. Consider two people asking you for help:

&gt;Hey \_\_\_\_, can you please do \_\_\_\_ for me? This is very urgent and blocking $IMPORTANT\_THING.

Consider that your $IMPORTANT\_THING isn't always their $IMPORTANT\_THING. Your emergency isn't always theirs. In a company that is unified it certainly should be, and we should all be empathetic and helpful when we can and have the bandwidth, but it's not always the hand we're dealt. Consider this slight change:

&gt;Hey \_\_\_\_, I know you're really busy and I'm sorry to bother you! We have an urgent ongoing issue and I'd really, really appreciate it if you could take some time to look!

Keep in mind these are all suggestions and things that have worked for me, but I've had much better luck with using the second version over the first. To reiterate: People love to appear busy. Especially at work. I don't know what it is about perpetually being busy, but it's a badge of honor in our work culture and to not be busy is to not be relevant. ***Also keep in mind that you yourself are not a metric by which to judge people. If you put in 80 hours a week at your salaried job, that's your prerogative. Do not hold that expectation of others.***

**Strong opinions are still opinions.** This one is very relevant in our field as there are many subjects which are inherently based on opinions which draw a lot of controversy. Spaces vs tabs, programming syntax, which language to use, which tools to use, log formatting, etc.. Sometimes we're opinionated about the problems that need to be solved. Do they need to be solved? What's the reason we're solving it?

Always be self-aware of when you're prescribing your opinion vs. when you're prescribing factual-based information. Pick your battles. If you like tabs, and the project uses spaces, that is not the battle to pick. It's not even really worth a mention unless you can do it without being a jerk. If you want to prescribe your strong opinions onto others then be prepared to back up why you wish to do so.

I recommend being objective, always. Do not make statements that cannot be backed up with other objective statements and explanations.

Identify why you're so strongly opinionated. Can you present your opinion in a way which shows it derives some mutual benefit?

Sometimes one opinion can be stronger than another opinion but this is usually rooted in **facts or history.** For example, the spaces vs. tabs talk is inherently based on opinion. If you walk into a project which uses tabs, and you are a spaces person, you ***do not just reformat the whole project to spaces. This will only make you appear to be an asshole.*** This is also a case where your ***opinion is wrong. Not in that one is superior to the other, but the fact that now when I run a diff in SCM across to revisions, you just created a shit-ton of change where there actually was none, making debugging harder and all because you felt your opinion was superior.*** 

**In closing -** I just wanted to possibly help some others in their communication style by providing some examples where I saw what I'd consider communication miss / failure, and examples that have personally worked wonders for me. I'm open to any additional input / advice / suggestions that could help others, as well, including if you want to indicate anywhere you disagree with the things I've said and make suggestions I might not have considered.

Just always be aware that if you aren't communicating at your job, something is wrong. If you aren't communicating ***effectively*** then you are going to hit unnecessary hurdles in your career; a career that is inherently difficult to navigate given the constant churn on technological advancement / changes. I highly recommend any new engineer to host as many lunch and learns, and project demos as they can (code you wrote, tools you wrote, etc..) to improve these skills early in their career, as it will pay massive dividends in the years to come. As for written communication, if you are communicating something that feels edgy / difficult, then sit on it for a bit and proof-read / reread it. Pretend you're the recipient and how you'd respond if you received it from yourself. Consider your relationship with the person you're sending to, and how they respond to and consume various types of communication. Always be learning about your peers and learn how to navigate their personalities in ways that increases your success without inhibiting theirs.

I previously tried my hand at management and it wasn't for me. Remaining a software engineer working on new apps or progressing to more of an architect role didn't appeal to me either; there are challenging problems to solve but they don't really hold my interest.

Recently, I decided to make the transition from software engineer to support engineer in search for lower stress and better work/life balance.

I couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed telling my dev friends that I moved into a support role... You're supposed to go the other way!

Although I don't work on feature development, we do have opportunities for creating internal tools which is something I enjoy doing. Plus, we only have chat/email support here which is great because phone support would've been a dealbreaker for me.

I get asked some dumb questions like, “What does SuchAndSuch function do?” And I reply, “Have you looked at the code? The comments at the top of the function describe what it does. Or have you taken five minutes to look at the code and see what it does, maybe read the comments in the code?” “No.” Or better yet “That’s 1000 lines, it will take me three a really long time to read it.”

My developers basically ask me exactly which lines to change and how. Then they blindly make the change, don’t test it, and blame me when QA returns their work. Is it too much to ask that they take a few minutes to consider the side effects of their change? Where is the ownership?

Am I taking crazy pills? Am I off base that I ask developers to read code before blindly changing a line? To read code that they may not be directly changing to get a better idea of what the whole thing does? 

I get that the project we’re on is a giant legacy codebase with some complex business processes and a million SQL stored procedures with all sorts of business logic embedded in them. It’s a decades old app with a terrible data model, but that’s what we’ve got.

I'm 37 currently (1.5+ year) working as C# .net 5 Blazor (wasm) developer. Many years spend in academia so i only have 3-5 years of real software engineering in enterprise (but many in academia plus research A.I. etc.).

I used java spring boot for tiny microservices in the past and React (and many others for smaller projects). I'd like to discuss the current state of our options as SWE. The goal is to choose next job tech.

First, C# and Visual studio was good but not bug free. Its slow, buggy and bloated but gets the job done. Blazor is ok but with such a small community, looks like a joke. (yes i know all the linq properties generics etc that c# offers comperated to other languages)

Now JAVA world, I like the idea of bigger community, more open source libraries, more used in academic research projects. Add to this the intellij which i'm sure it will fly in \*nix environments. It feels that (statistical speaking) companies and people who use java, care more about slow steady golden standards design arch etc.(and i love this) than C# one where it feels like they care more about get the job done quick and dirty (ofcouse it also depends from where you work).

Now add to this the new macbooks M1. Its not a minor event, if you work 8+ hours per day, you want tools that you like (like taxi drivers , its better with mercedes :P ) and if those machine deliver the stable os and speedy env with such a battery life, its something. (although linux is already better and more stable than windows but i prefer win or mac because of compatibility).

Q1: How do i get in java job, when everyone is asking for years of java experience, even if i got hired i'll be in junior-like position. (although i dont care for the title, im speaking strictly financially). (so how to escape MS world without pay cut)

Q2: What would you choose as a next career tech stack (c# ,java or..) maybe python or node etc (i'm already full stack so react + some backend is my goal). Do you see a pattern on companies choosing c#  or java? (eg software houses and scientific oriented orgs choose python java where traditional businesses industries choose c# MS where SWE is second class citizen)

Q3: Those who used both C#.Net and java (spring etc.) (or maybe python etc.) which one did you enjoy more (holistic approach) regarding IDE OS job opportunities, flow of dev - CI/CD, colleagues etc. caring about design. Add to this that .net with blazor wasm, although  it was good sharing models, it mixes the concepts of front-back (there are cons and pros, like nodejs/typescript/react-angular).
